100002,Quinta dos Avidagos 2011 Avidagos Red (Douro),"This is ripe and fruity, a wine that is smooth while still structured.

100007,Terre di Giurfo 2013 Belsito Frappato (Vittoria),"Here's a bright, informal red that opens with aromas of candied berry, white pepper and savory herb that carry over to the palate. It's balanced with fresh acidity and soft tannins.",Terre di Giurfo,Italy,87,16,Frappato

100131,Ceretto 2003 Bricco Rocche Brunate (Barolo),"At the first it was quite muted and subdued, but over a ten minute period it developed beautifully in the glass. The dark fruit is still dominant, but it is beginning to show some interesting tertiary aromas of earth, mushrooms and leather. Well balanced with a medium finish.

100134,Poderi Luigi Einaudi 2003 Barolo,"Einaudi's wines have been improving lately, and this Barolo was very impressive, given the trying conditions of the vintage.

100135,Clark-Clauden 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Give this young Cab time in the cellar to come around. Right now, it's fresh and tannic, with primary fruit blackberry and cherry flavors, and the sweet smoky oak hasn't been integrated.

100138,Beaumont 2005 Hope Marguerite Chenin Blanc (Walker Bay),"This is great Chenin Blanc, wood fermented but still leaving all the varietal character.

The acidity is very high and palate-cleansing. The wine was half fermented in barrels, half in stainless steel. Sommeliers, buy this by the case, if you can find it.",Banyan,US,90,17,Riesling

100148,Vincent Vineyards 2012 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"Black cherry, black plum and black currant are integrated well into the fresh dill and smoke scents on the nose of this wine from one of the region's newest properties.

100161,Château Vincens 2012 Malbec (Cahors),"Low-yield vines on the best parcels of the Vincens estate are the source of this wine.

100168,Dracaena 2013 Cabernet Franc (Paso Robles),"The addition of 15% Petite Sirah takes this bottling to a compelling place, showing barely ripe blackberries, animal fat, smoke, black pepper and a wild clove element on the nose. It's rich and layered on the palate, where chalky tannins support black cherry, grilled beef and mint flavors. This has the bones to last awhile.",Dracaena,US,91,28,Cabernet Franc
100169,Duckhorn 2012 Rector Creek Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"A fairly elegant expression of the variety, this wine is bright in cherry kirsch and pretty aromas of rose petal and lavender, structured to age and enjoy with food. Rector Creek Vineyard is just north of Yountville and planted in rocky alluvial soils. Drink now through 2022.",Duckhorn,US,91,95,Merlot
100170,Dutton-Goldfield 2014 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine is put together from multiple vineyard sources, including the well-known Morelli Lane and Widdoes, all farmed by the Duttons. Larger in production than many of the vineyard-designates, it offers baked bread and juicy overtones of cranberry-raspberry layered atop luxuriously toasted oak. It'll show well at the table.",Dutton-Goldfield,US,91,44,Pinot Noir
100171,Fritz Haag 2014 Brauneberger Feinherb Riesling (Mosel),"Fresh and fragrant of blossoms, tart yellow peach and apricot, this off-dry Riesling maintains a crystalline fruit purity that persists throughout Fritz Haag's wines. It's invigorating and irresistably quaffable. The long, melon-rind finish is lip smacking.",Fritz Haag,Germany,91,30,Riesling
100172,Fritz Haag 2014 Riesling (Mosel),"Just a touch of honey-lemon sweetness is enough to make this zesty, citrus-focused Riesling lip smackingly delicious. Fresh, green herb and lime notes reverberate through a strong finish. Drinks well now but should meld nicely over the next five years.",Fritz Haag,Germany,91,22,Riesling
100173,G7 2012 The 7th Generation Gran Reserva Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Loncomilla Valley),"Dry, spicy aromas of tobacco, cedar, vanilla and berry fruits come together nicely. This Maule Valley Cab is fresh and harmonious across the palate, with nothing too pushy. Complex, balsamic flavors of olives, herbs, dried berries, turned earth and cocoa finish dry, peppery and elegant. Drink through 2019.",G7,Chile,91,20,Cabernet Sauvignon
100174,Le Cadeau 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This wine is bursting with gorgeous cherry fruit, forward and luscious. The tannins are ripe and the acids in perfect proportion, keeping the fruit flavors buoyed upon a textural ride into a lingering finish.",Le Cadeau,US,91,38,Pinot Noir
100175,Stoneleigh 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"The Stoneleigh style traditionally favors ripeness over herbaceousness, and the 2008 holds true to form, offering up grapefruit and nectarine aromas and an appealing blend of citrus and stone-fruit flavors. It's plump and round, yet finishes fresh. Good as an apéritif or with light dishes.",Stoneleigh,New Zealand,88,19,Sauvignon Blanc
100176,Tenuta Peter Sölva & Söhne 2007 De Silva Sauvignon (Alto Adige),"Crisp and fresh with enduring aromas of tomato leaf, citrus, pink grapefruit and white stone, this is textbook Sauvignon from the mountainous Alto Adige region of Italy. Pair it with appetizers or lightly spicy foods.",Tenuta Peter Sölva & Söhne,Italy,88,25,Sauvignon
100177,TerraMater 2006 Unusual Cabernet-Shiraz-Zinfandel Red (Maipo Valley),"Haven't seen this unusual combination of grapes in quite some time, and you know what, it's much better now than when we last saw it in 2001. This vintage has a nice, almost magnetic nose, while the palate is firm and well structured, with cassis, black cherry, coffee and licorice flavors. It's a bit boring on the finish, but the mouthfeel and length are just fine. Fruity, rich and balanced. 325 cases made.",TerraMater,Chile,88,50,Red Blend
100178,Isole e Olena 2005 Chianti Classico,"This Chianti Classico strikes a beautiful balance between elegance and intensity. It has both and its pretty aromas of wild berry, rose, ginger, anise and spice come forth in a continuous, steady manner. It feels bright and lively in the mouth and ends with a touch of piquant spice.",Isole e Olena,Italy,88,22,Sangiovese
100179,Kenwood 2005 Jack London Vineyard Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"Black as a moonless night, dense in structure, tannic, bone dry and super-peppery, this Syrah isn't offering much relief right now. In all likelihood it will emerge from its cocoon in a few years to offer a wealth of ripe blackberry, currant and carob fruit.",Kenwood,US,88,25,Syrah
100180,La Chablisienne 2006 Les Vénérables Vieilles Vignes (Chablis),"The impact of 50-year old vines is seen in the concentrated fruit, ripe and full, in this wine. The flavors are of fresh apricots, edged with green apples and pink grapefruit, a combination that shows both richness and great freshness. The finish is a reminder of the fine acidity in 2006.",La Chablisienne,France,88,27,Chardonnay
100181,Manzoni 2006 Lucia Highland Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is a strong, oaky Chardonnay. It's crisp in acidity and forward in pineapple jam, lemon custard and vanilla meringue flavors. If you like the ripe, California style, it's for you.",Manzoni,US,88,23,Chardonnay
100182,McIntyre Vineyards 2006 Mission Ranch Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco),"Crisp, coastal acidity dominates this wine, making it mouth-wateringly tart. May be too much for some folks, but it's quite elegant, with good cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors enriched with a touch of smoky oak.",McIntyre Vineyards,US,88,36,Pinot Noir
100183,Abbadia Ardenga 2003 M. Vigna (Brunello di Montalcino),"Loaded with bold, ripe fruit, exotic spice and leather, this is a simple but genuine expression of Brunello di Montalcino. The wine tastes thick and a bit chunky in the mouth because of its chewy, succulent tannins.",Abbadia Ardenga,Italy,88,,Sangiovese Grosso
100184,Alamos 2007 Torrontés (Salta),"With attractive melon and other tropical aromas, this is a Torrontés that rises above the masses. It smells great and tastes like a pure blend of lychee fruit, tangerine and honeydew melon. The palate feel is smooth and round, and the finish is dry, clean and healthy. It's everything that Torrontés should be. Drink now.",Alamos,Argentina,88,12,Torrontés
100185,Anaba 2007 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"This is a typical Sonoma Coast Chard in the bright acidity that firms up the ripe, long hangtime flavors. Pineapples, pears, peaches, nectarines and subtle papaya notes are joined with buttercream and cinnamon spices. Drink now.",Anaba,US,88,35,Chardonnay
100186,Apaltagua 2007 Envero Gran Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Composed and structured, with its fair share of richness manifested as raisin and molasses. Interestingly, the palate rings with acidity, resulting in a feel that's borderline sharp. But there's enough fruit and heft to balance things out, and the flavors of cherry, blackberry and cola are nice. A good example of elevated Carmenère (with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon) that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.",Apaltagua,Chile,88,15,Carmenère
100187,Harrington 2006 Wiley Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This is a very rich Pinot whose primary virtue is fruit. It just explodes with delicious cherry jam, red currant, licorice and mocha flavors. Dry and crisply acidic, it's a beautiful wine for early drinking.",Harrington,US,88,40,Pinot Noir
100188,Abbazia Santa Anastasia 2003 Montenero Red (Sicilia),"This is a luminous, mature red wine with thick concentration and huge—almost too much—emphasis on toasted oak. Aromas recall vanilla, spice and coffee, although you will find blueberry and cherry on the finish: It is a blend of Nero d'Avola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.",Abbazia Santa Anastasia,Italy,88,48,Red Blend
100189,Viña Bisquertt 2007 Casa La Joya Reserve Merlot (Colchagua Valley),"Bisquertt usually does well with its value-priced Merlots, and seeing that 2007 was an excellent vintage in Chile, this wine excels in the value price range. The nose is dark and saturated, but pure and inviting. And the palate is ripe and smooth, with spice, plum, blackberry and herb notes, particularly anise. Finishes clean, smooth and peppery. Drink now.",Viña Bisquertt,Chile,88,11,Merlot
100190,Emiliana 2008 Natura Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Clean and honest up front, with moderate richness and modest telltale Casablanca pineapple aromas. The plate is creamier than many wines in this price range, with flavors of apple cider, citrus and some pith. Overall this is a good value wine with enough citrus and acidity to qualify it as fresh.",Emiliana,Chile,87,11,Chardonnay
100191,Fattoria Alois 2007 Campole Red (Campania),"Chocolate, espresso, plum and black currant are backed by smoky nuances and natural rubber.

100192,Henry's Drive Vignerons 2006 The Trial of John Montford Cabernet Sauvignon (Padthaway),"From the little-known region of Padthaway, this Cabernet starts off with some very promising, perfumed aromas of mint and cassis, but then shows touches of chocolate and raisined fruit on the palate. It's soft and mouthfilling—an easy-drinking Cab to consume on the young side.",Henry's Drive Vignerons,Australia,87,30,Cabernet Sauvignon
100193,Aldegheri 2003 Le Pietre Santambrogio Red (Rosso del Veronese),"Here's an interesting blend of Corvina, Cabernet Sauvignon and Rondinella that reflects the aromas and power of each grape variety. The wine offers mature notes of cherry, clove, blackberry and cola: It tastes slightly sweet and very succulent.",Aldegheri,Italy,87,20,Red Blend
100194,Bertrand Ambroise 2006 St.-Romain,"A citrus-dominated wine, lime and lemon giving a crisp intensity. There is a somewhat bitter toast element, but the acidity, the fresh fruits and the soft structure act as a counter-balance. Give it six months to a year. Screwcap.",Bertrand Ambroise,France,87,35,Chardonnay
100195,Campomaggio 2005 Chianti Classico,"Here's a traditional Chianti Classico with pretty aromas of cherry cola, mesquite, almonds and violets. The wine is compact and elegant in the mouth and offers crisp berry flavors on the close.",Campomaggio,Italy,87,,Sangiovese
100196,Carpineto 2003 Riserva (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"This is a mature, jammy wine with thick layers of plum, prune and raisin. The wine's appearance is dark and concentrated and that same sensation of heaviness carries over the palate in the form of black currant and spice. The tannins are firm and tart.",Carpineto,Italy,87,35,Prugnolo Gentile
100197,Cesani 2007 Pancole (Vernaccia di San Gimignano),"Pancole is a pretty expression of Tuscany's popular Vernaccia di San Gimignano with a luminous, bright appearance and pristine aromas of stone and passion fruits. The wine is lean and tonic with spicy notes on the finish.",Cesani,Italy,87,18,Vernaccia
100198,Spier 2014 21 Gables Chenin Blanc (Western Cape),"This is a concentrated, fairly full and lush Chenin, rich in toasty oak and vanilla cream as well as notes of baked apple pie and sweet orange. The medium-weight palate is mouthfilling and satisfying, with ample acidity to lift the decadent flavors. Notes of clove, anise and toasted nuts mingle on the lingering finish. Drink now–2019.",Spier,South Africa,90,23,Chenin Blanc
100199,Sequum 2013 Four Soil Mélange Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a soft, well-crafted wine from the eastern side of St. Helena that's both classic in its dried herb, tobacco and tea aromas and fruity with red currant and cranberry notes.",Sequum,US,90,60,Cabernet Sauvignon
100200,Sierra Starr 2014 Rising Starr Estate Bottled Cabernet Franc (Nevada County),"This is a beatifully balanced, not-too-full-bodied wine from vines grown at 2,400 feet in the Sierra range. It has classic black cherry, black olive and anise aromas, harmonious fruit flavors accented with light oak spiciness and a firm, fine-grained tannic structure.",Sierra Starr,US,90,28,Cabernet Franc
100201,Tenuta di Sesta 2011 Riserva (Brunello di Montalcino),"Aromas of mature black-skinned berry, tobacco and dark spice lead the way. The rounded palate offers dried cherry, raspberry, coffee and a licorice note alongside velvety if not very persistent tannins. Showing the heat of the vintage, this is evolving quickly so enjoy over the next several years.",Tenuta di Sesta,Italy,90,,Sangiovese
100202,Terlan 2014 Nova Domus Riserva White (Alto Adige),"Made with 60% Pinot Bianco, 30% Chardonnay and 10% Sauvignon Blanc, this boasts appealing aromas of acacia flower, nectarine and Alpine herb. The elegant palate delivers juicy Gala apple, yellow peach and a touch of ginger alongside fresh acidity.",Terlan,Italy,90,62,White Blend
100203,Yatir 2011 Syrah (Judean Hills),"This wine features pleasing aromas of raspberry, jumper berry and black pepper. There is a nice mélange of fruit and spice flavors, notably black cherry, dark plums, anise, and cardamom. Smooth tannins ply the palate right into a bright finish that bears a touch of salinity.",Yatir,Israel,90,50,Syrah
100204,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2012 Montes Claros Garrafeira Red (Alentejo),"A year in wood and 30 months in bottle before release have allowed this attractive wine to fully develop its solid yet smooth texture. It has concentration, layers of bright black currant fruit and vibrant acidity. Ready to drink.",Adega Cooperativa de Borba,Portugal,90,28,Portuguese Red
100205,J. Lohr 2014 Gesture G-S-M (Paso Robles),"This bottling belongs to a series of wines from the legendary Jerry Lohr emphasizing Rhône varieties. It shows candied blackberry, violets and potpourri on the fruity, flowery and inviting nose. The palate leads with savory black pepper, which accents its core of black plum, blackberry and purple flower flavors.",J. Lohr,US,90,30,G-S-M
100206,J. Lohr 2015 October Night Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),"Rich honeysuckle, marzipan and oak aromas meet bright lemongrass on the nose of this bottling, showing both the fresh and oxidative sides of the grape. Smoked chicken and brioche notes are prominent on the palate, leading to a tangy, botanical, juniper-laced finish.",J. Lohr,US,90,25,Chardonnay
100207,Courtney Benham 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is an extraordiary deal for a solidly built, high-level wine. It offers succulent cherry, raspberry and vanilla flavors, wrapped in approachable, mellowed tannin and oak.",Courtney Benham,US,90,25,Cabernet Sauvignon
100208,Del Carlo Winery 2014 Home Ranch Teldeschi Vineyards Century Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Juicy and austere in understated waves of cranberry and cherry fruit, this wine delivers subtle power and intensity in a leathery-textured package. True to its old vine heritage, it shows a dry dustiness of peppery spice.",Del Carlo Winery,US,90,32,Zinfandel
100209,Delaire Graff 2013 Reserve White (Coastal Region),"A stony, flinty character leads the nose of this blend of 54% Sauvignon Blanc and 46% Sémillon, followed by scents of ripe peach, nectarine, freshly dried grass and herbs. The medium-weight palate offers more clean fruit flavors that result in a smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Ample acidity lends freshness to the finish, alongside a lingering yellow flower character. Drink now–2019.",Delaire Graff,South Africa,90,40,White Blend
100210,Domaine St Pierre 2014 Red (Côtes du Rhône),"Intriguing, thought provoking and complex, this wine starts off with perfumed aromas of thyme, bay leaf and lavender. It's supple in the mouth and silky in feel, imbued with black cherry and blueberry fruit, then shows a hint of adhesive bandage on the finish. Drink now.",Domaine St Pierre,France,90,16,Rhône-style Red Blend
100211,Eikendal 2014 Chardonnay (Western Cape),"This leads with clean yet soft scents of ripe apple, Anjoy pear and orange blossom. Those notes carry through to the medium-weight palate, well integrated with soft toasted-oak tones. It's harmonious and balanced, with ample acidity lending good lift through the close. Drink now.",Eikendal,South Africa,90,20,Chardonnay
100212,Famille Perrin 2013 Les Christins Red (Vacqueyras),"This is taut and sinewy in profile, but shows off a fine range of aromas, from thyme and lavender to cocoa, red plum and ripe cherry. The raspberry and herb flavors finish in a storm of firm tannins. Drink 2020–2025.",Famille Perrin,France,90,32,Rhône-style Red Blend
100213,Matarromera 2015 Fermentado en Barrica Verdejo (Rueda),"Mellow white-fruit aromas are nonspecific and oaky, but not overly so. This barrel-fermented Verdejo feels plump and chunky, with balancing acidity. Salty melon, apricot and apple flavors end steady and long. For barrel-fermented Verdejo, this is at the top of the pile.",Matarromera,Spain,90,40,Verdejo
100214,MCV 2014 1105 Red (Paso Robles),"This blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 21% Syrah, 7% Grenache, 6% Petit Verdot, 5% Tannat and 1% Viognier is tightly wound but likely to improve with time. Opened now, it offers elderberry, black currant, pencil lead and loam on the nose, with lava rock, crème de cassis and kirsch flavors slowing emerging on the palate.",MCV,US,90,48,Red Blend
100215,Mounts 2014 Verah Red (Dry Creek Valley),"This is a big, brawny expression of Grenache, Mourvèdre, Syrah and Counoise, the Grenache playing the dominant role in the blend. It coats the palate in dense raspberry and blueberry fruit, seasoned with pepper and nutmeg. A leathery touch to the texture and lifted acidity keeps it from feeling heavy or overdone.",Mounts,US,90,36,Rhône-style Red Blend
100216,Or Haganuz 2014 French Blend Red (Galilee),"Aromas of blackberry, fennel bulb and smoke set the scene for flavors of cherry, raspberry, chocolate and tobacco leaf. Mellow but ever-apparent tannins ply the palate alongside a strong bolt of acidity that tapers off into a pomegranate-imbued finish.",Or Haganuz,Israel,90,80,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
100217,Podere Scopetone 2012 Brunello di Montalcino,"Black-skinned berry, pipe tobacco and Mediterranean herb aromas waft out of the glass and carry over to the firm linear palate along with morello cherry, licorice and a hint of clove. Taut fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the backbone while orange peel marks the finish. Drink 2019–2025.",Podere Scopetone,Italy,90,57,Sangiovese
100218,Quinta de Foz de Arouce 2013 Red (Beira Atlantico),"Wood aging gives this ripe blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional its richness and density. It's full of black fruit, toast and a touch of pepper. With ripe tannins and crisp acidity, it can easily age another year. Drink from 2018.",Quinta de Foz de Arouce,Portugal,90,20,Portuguese Red
100219,Robert Mondavi 2015 Fumé Blanc (Napa Valley),"Pithy, with grapefruit and lemon peel flavors, this wine is deceptively crisp and light on the nose, offering a wealth of body and lushness on the palate, accented with nutmeg and peach. It includes 4% Sémillon, partly from the winery's beloved To Kalon vineyard.",Robert Mondavi,US,90,20,Fumé Blanc
100220,Samuel Tinon 2015 Megyer Dry Furmint (Tokaj),"From a vineyard in Northern Tokaj this dry Furmint has aromas of citrus pith and freshly cut pineapple. In the mouth, there are delightful flavors of grapefruit juice and white peach before the pleasantly acidic finish.",Samuel Tinon,Hungary,90,36,Furmint
100221,Sixteen by Twenty 2014 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Briny green olive notes underlie a tropically ripe, full-bodied expression of the variety. The wine's apple, pineapple and mango fruit is wrapped in toasted oak and moderate acidity.",Sixteen by Twenty,US,90,40,Chardonnay
100222,St. Pauls 2014 Passion Riserva Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige),"This opens with enticing aromas of chamomile flower, white peach and a whiff of Alpine herb. The elegant palate offers McIntosh apple, candied lemon and a vein of energizing mineral. Fresh acidity lends balance.",St. Pauls,Italy,90,40,Pinot Bianco
100223,Talenti 2011 Trentennale (Brunello di Montalcino),"Chopped herb, forest floor, leather, espresso and a balsamic note are some of the aromas that waft out of the glass. The powerfully structured palate delivers prune, dried cherry, tobacco, and roasted coffee bean framed in firm fine-grained tannins. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink to capture the fruit richness. Drink 2018–2023.",Talenti,Italy,90,,Sangiovese
100224,Terlan 2015 Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige),"Bright and creamy, this savory white offers aromas and flavors of ripe apple, Bartlett pear, Alpine herb and a citrus note. Fresh acidity and a mineral vein energize the finish.",Terlan,Italy,90,,Pinot Bianco
100225,Mendel 2014 Lunta Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"Blackberry and road-tar aromas are dark and stout. This is moderately tannic and a bit rough and jagged on the palate. Flavors of stewed black plum and prune are ripe almost to an extreme, and that's how it finishes as well.",Mendel,Argentina,90,22,Malbec
100226,Oldenburg 2013 Chardonnay (Stellenbosch),"There's a pleasant, toasty seam throughout the nose and mouth of this well-balanced wine, expressed in notes of sweet spice and honeycomb that frame the yellow melon and apple fruit core. It's plush and mouthfilling, but not flabby or overdone, thanks to balancing acidity and an assertive spicy tone that dominates the finish. Drink now.",Oldenburg,South Africa,90,25,Chardonnay
100227,Oldenburg 2014 Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch),"This is a round and rich wine, with notes of wood-grilled apple, guava and toasted challah. Smooth and lush in feel, ripe peach and tropical tones drive the palate, while hints of honeysuckle and baking spice unfold on the finish. Ample acidity keeps the wine's weight in check. Drink now.",Oldenburg,South Africa,90,20,Chenin Blanc
100228,Wagner 2006 Grace House Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),"The deep ruby color belies this wines cool-climate origins. The nose shows more black fruit aromas than is typical for Pinot Noir. The palate is all Pinot, though, with cherry pie filling flavors made more complex by vanilla from toasty new oak. It finishes with some nice mineral and earth notes. Silky tannins allow for immediate consumption but the wine will gain in complexity after a year or two in the cellar.",Wagner,US,85,15,Pinot Noir
100229,Treleaven 2006 Semi-Dry Riesling (Cayuga Lake),"A thoroughly honest effort, opening with lovely quince, apple and lemon fruit. The palate has a crisp lime edge and finishes with a kick of refreshing acidity. Drink now.",Treleaven,US,85,14,Riesling
100230,Benessere 2005 Costa Del Sol Red (Napa Valley),"Not clear what the varietal blend is, but it's like a nice, easy southern Rhône wine. Soft and fruity, it's rich in jammy blackberry, cherry, Mandarin orange, chocolate and anise spice flavors.",Benessere,US,85,18,Red Blend
100231,Bloomer Creek 2006 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"Orange blossom and flowers lead on this Gewürtz, and on the palate, a citric, lemon edge outweighs the sweet and floral components that would give this wine a prettier edge. Nonetheless, the wine has an attractive, crisp and clean character and will pair well with grilled seafood and poultry.",Bloomer Creek,US,85,16,Gewürztraminer
100232,Andean Sky 2007 Bonarda (Mendoza),"Meaty and rubbery, but that's young Bonarda. This is a sound wine with dark berry flavors, raisin and pulsing acidity. Still, there's modest roundness to the palate and length to the finish. Overall, it's tasty, full and borderline raisiny. Drink now.",Andean Sky,Argentina,85,10,Bonarda
100233,Angove's 2006 Red Belly Black Shiraz (South Australia),Lifted cedar and pine notes interspersed with appealing woodsy scents give way to a surprisingly intense palate that shows some nice peppery notes but ultimately falls short on the finish. Nearly imperceptible tannins suggest early consumption.,Angove's,Australia,85,12,Shiraz
100234,Silvan Ridge 2006 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"There is an odd, piercing edge to the aromas, a mix of acetic acid and pungent herb, with a hint of diesel. Somehow it's not off-putting, just atypical. The light, tart fruit is a mix of rhubarb and cranberry, very earthy and tasting of dirt and bark in the finish. This could be quite pleasant with a hearty, rustic dish such as beef Bourgogne.",Silvan Ridge,US,85,28,Pinot Noir
100235,Talamonti 2007 Cerasuolo Rosè (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),"Neutral and unassuming on first impact, this luminous rosé eventually delivers notes of mineral, ash, stone fruit and small berry. The wine offers more in the mouth, however, where it exhibits fresh flavors of raspberry and blueberry.",Talamonti,Italy,85,10,Montepulciano
100236,Testarossa 2006 Thompson Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Overly sweet and simple, and something of a disappointment given the winery's past performance, this Syrah tastes like melted cherry jam, stirred with chocolate pie filling and sprinkled with fennel and pepper.",Testarossa,US,85,49,Syrah
100237,Meeker 2004 Kiss Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"Shows rich, firm mountain tannins and well-ripened, concentrated flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and cocoa, and is thoroughly dry. But the wine loses a few points for hot caramelization, which may be partly over-charred oak and partly shriveled, overripe berries, if not both.",Meeker,US,85,85,Cabernet Sauvignon
100238,Consorzio Vini Tipici di San Marino NV Moscato (San Marino),"The wine boasts a beautiful appearance thanks to its saturated golden color and faint amber highlights. It has a very fragrant nose and offers honey, peach and soapy floral notes. In the mouth, the wine delivers sweet fruit and a soft, silky texture.",Consorzio Vini Tipici di San Marino,Italy,85,18,Moscato
100239,D'Arenberg 2006 The Derelict Vineyard Grenache (McLaren Vale),"The sort of wine one imagines early Australian settlers gulped down—big and burly in the mouth and a bit warm, rough and dusty on the finish. Hints of mint-accented cherry fruit and earthy notes.",D'Arenberg,Australia,85,29,Grenache
100240,Dogwood 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino),"A little rough and rugged, with jangly tannins and blackberry fruit so ripe it veers into raisins. Very dry, it's probably at its best now.",Dogwood,US,85,36,Cabernet Sauvignon
100241,Domaine du Tariquet 2007 Ugni Blanc-Colombard (Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne),"Dominated by Ugni Blanc, the grape also used in the local Armagnac brandy, this is a tight, crisp wine, green but not unpleasantly so. Its acidity comes from fresh apple flavors, touched with some good juiciness and a fine refreshing finish. Screwcap.",Domaine du Tariquet,France,85,9,Ugni Blanc-Colombard
100242,Falcor 2005 Sangiovese (Napa Valley),"Sweetly rich in cherry, red currant and chocolate flavors, with a peppery edge, this Sangiovese is soft in structure. The bright acidity can cut through tomato sauce with cheese.",Falcor,US,85,34,Sangiovese
100243,Hayman & Hill 2007 Reserve Selection Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Made in the modern California style, with very ripe, rather sweet pineapple jam, green apple butter and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture.",Hayman & Hill,US,85,15,Chardonnay
100244,Hermann J. Wiemer 2002 Blanc de Blanc Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"This sparkling wine starts with a toasty but soft nose, leading into clean but fruity flavors and a refreshing finish. Though an earlier release might have allowed more primary fruit to show through, the wine offers easygoing but elegant enjoyment.",Hermann J. Wiemer,US,85,30,Chardonnay
100245,J. & F. Lurton 2007 Herederos de François Lurton Villafrance de Duero Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"Simple but well-maded wine with aromas of chewing gum, cherry and blackberry. It's a plump, sort of grabby red with sweet raspberry and chocolate flavors followed by a creamy, soft finish. Not much complexity but good fruit and depth. Not the least bit hard to drink. Good mass wine.",J. & F. Lurton,Spain,85,13,Red Blend
100246,Finca Las Moras 2007 Reserve Chardonnay (San Juan),"Not exactly a world-class white wine but at least it smells and tastes like Chardonnay.

A fresh, young wine that should be drunk soon.",Finca Las Moras,Argentina,85,12,Chardonnay
100247,Long Flat 2006 Destinations Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills),"Juicy and well balanced, this is an admirable effort at the price.

Drink now.",Long Flat,Australia,85,15,Sauvignon Blanc
100248,Work 2004 Reserve Merlot (Sonoma Mountain),"Tasty, with pie-filling cherries, blackberries and currants accented with smoky oak, but a little on the soft side. Fully developed, so drink now.",Work,US,85,25,Merlot
100249,Amity 2006 Estate Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This seems as if it was assembled from lesser barrels. It's pleasant, very light, simple and tart; the dominant flavor is cranberry juice.",Amity,US,85,45,Pinot Noir
100250,Autumn Hill 2007 Petit Verdot-Merlot Red (Monticello),"Cherry pie-filling and boysenberry notes open this impressive blend of Merlot and Petit Verdot. Abundant but velvety tannins give a lift to blueberry and chocolate tones in the mouth, while the slightly grippy finish shows appealing mixed berry flavors.",Autumn Hill,US,85,18,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
100251,Blue Rock 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Ripe, soft and a little sweet, with jellied flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and anise. Drink now.",Blue Rock,US,85,49,Cabernet Sauvignon
100252,Cherry Hill 2006 Papillon Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Spicy and tannic, this inexpensive Pinot from Cherry Hill opens with earthy fruit and leaf flavors—tomato and herb dominate, with just a suggestion of berry.

100253,Cloud 9 2006 Seity Zinfandel (Amador County),"Shows the briary, brambly character of Foothills Zin, with an array of wild berry, tobacco, mocha and Asian spice flavors wrapped into finely ground tannins.

100254,Cueva de las Manos 2007 Reserve Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"Huge in color and extract, but also a little childish. The nose has gumball, berry jam and a touch of volatility, but after things settle it rests on bold black fruit. It's not overly rich or sweet, and the feel is sort of sinewy. Seems more about size and color than refinement and polish.",Cueva de las Manos,Argentina,85,15,Malbec
100255,David Fulton 2008 Petite Sirah (St. Helena),"The winery has a good track record with this bottling, which shows how well Petite Sirah does in the warmer St. Helena appellation of Napa Valley. This '08 is dryish to moderately sweet in jammy blackberries and blueberries, with a smoked meat, bacon edge. But it's also firmly tannic, which provides a framework for the sweetness.",David Fulton,US,89,45,Petite Sirah
100256,Esterlina 2009 Reserva Pinot Noir (Cole Ranch),"Esterlina's Pinot is very perfumey, light in body and soul at first, as it gathers steam with a tasty backbone of lush red fruit, spice and plenty of staying power over a meal.",Esterlina,US,89,55,Pinot Noir

100258,Graham Beck 2007 The William Red (Coastal Region),"This approachable Cabernet-based blend, which also has 18% Pinotage, 11% Cab Franc and 2% Shiraz, is a spicy and balanced red with notes of menthol, purple florals, black cherry and berry. With a mouthfeel like crushed velvet, a black pepper finish and an attractive price tag, it's a shame only 100 cases were produced.",Graham Beck,South Africa,89,18,Red Blend

100261,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2009 Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Young, tart and wrapped up tight as a drum, this offers sharp flavors of cranberry and a bit of Campari. It has the heft and polish to open up further with some additional bottle age, but it isn't budging at the moment.",Willamette Valley Vineyards,US,89,40,Pinot Noir
100262,Algodon 2008 Estate Blend Gran Reserva Red,"A blend of 50% Malbec with Cabernet, Syrah and Merlot that's lightly minty and full of tobacco, pepper and spicy aromas. Feels a bit clampy and tannic, with oaky, herbal flavors of plum and sweet berry. Shows a hint of green and drying tannins on the finish.",Algodon,Argentina,89,37,Red Blend
100263,Beaver Creek 2008 Fairytale Red (Napa Valley),"Beaver Creek makes a variation of Fairytale every vintage and this one, sourced from Napa Valley, is 41% Merlot, 36% Zinfandel and 23% Syrah, a mix that seems to work very nicely here. The wine's Zin almost tastes as if it has mountain tannins; the wine is overall herbal and earthy, ripe and sturdy with balanced fruit.",Beaver Creek,US,89,39,Red Blend
100264,Byron 2009 Monument Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A very good Pinot Noir, rich in cherry, licorice, cola and spice flavors that are wrapped into firm tannins.

100265,Jardin 2007 Syrah (Stellenbosch),"A good amount of earthy spice, tea leaves and forrest floor lead the way on the nose, but the black cherry and berry fruit aromas follow shortly after with an additional accent of sweet cured meat.

100267,Kaiken 2008 Corte Malbec-Bonarda-Petit Verdot Red (Mendoza),"For an under-$15 red blend, Corte has it going on. It's rich and full, almost syrupy on the nose, with lots of oak, ink and vanilla. Shows power and packs a punch, with dark berry, chocolate and spicy flavors. A little tannic and scratchy, but with structure and framework to spare. Malbec (80%), with Bonarda and Petit Verdot.",Kaiken,Argentina,89,14,Red Blend

A great food wine: pair with grilled fish or clams.",My Big Fat Greek Wine,Greece,89,15,Assyrtico
100273,Nals Margreid 2010 Sirmian Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige),"This partially oak-aged expression of Pinot Bianco from cool-climate Alto Adige (in the far north of Italy) offers a lovely texture that is creamy and smooth at the same time.

100282,Cambria 2011 Bench Break Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This is another fine Pinot from Cambria, showing the winery's great price-quality ratio. Words like opulent and elegant come to mind to describe intense flavors of black cherries, licorice, cola, herb tea and Indian spices.

100294,Kilikanoon 2009 Green's Vineyard Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"This wine displays ample concentration in its inky color and potent aromas of dark berry fruit. There's a hint of raisining as well. In the mouth, it's mouthfilling but lacks a bit of texture; the flavors include dark plums, vanilla and hints of dried fruits, like figs and dates. With a finish that calls to mind chocolate fudge (minus the sugar), opt for drinking this wine over the relatively near term, now to 2020.",Kilikanoon,Australia,92,70,Shiraz

100327,Marsuret NV Extra Dry (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),Drying mineral tones face off with luscious peach flavors to create a well-balanced Extra Dry Prosecco sparkler. The bubbly offers cheerful foaming in the mouth and sweet fruit flavors on the close.,Marsuret,Italy,86,15,Prosecco
100328,De Martino 2007 Legado Reserva Chardonnay (Limarí Valley),"Opening aromas of vanilla cookie show a resemblance to Animal Crackers, while the palate is more vivacious and tangy, with flavors of orange, tangerine and apple. We wouldn't call this an elegant or refined wine, but we like its no-issues attitude and citrusy content. Probably good with salads and seafood.",De Martino,Chile,86,18,Chardonnay
100329,Beringer 2007 Alluvium Blanc White (Knights Valley),"This New World blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon, Chardonnay and Viognier is very fruity. It offers a blast of pineapples, honeysuckles, peaches and figs, with a coating of oaky, vanilla buttercream.",Beringer,US,86,16,White Blend
100330,Brutocao 2006 Reserve Zinfandel (Mendocino),"With a fruity-sugary finish, this Zin will appeal to folks who like their red wines a little on the sweet side. It has pleasantly ripe flavors of black cherries, raspberries, red currants, root beer, mocha and pepper.",Brutocao,US,86,34,Zinfandel
100331,Clos La Chance 2006 Lila's Cuvée Red (Central Coast),"This Rhône-style blend is a little rustic and sharp in tannins and acids. It shows a polished core of jammy blackberries, cherries and spices, and could develop in a year or two.",Clos La Chance,US,86,40,Red Blend
100332,Cono Sur 2008 Visión Gewürztraminer (Casablanca Valley),"Frosted aromas of orange creamsicle, lychee and melon give this an elevated, unique sort of bouquet. Among Chilean Gewürztraminers, this is one of the more expressive ones you'll find. Pineapple, mango and other tropical flavors are pleasant, while the feel is forward and fun. Drink this summer with fish and salads.",Cono Sur,Chile,86,15,Gewürztraminer
100333,Sommariva NV Palazzo Rosso Brut (Prosecco di Conegliano),"This Prosecco Brut from the slightly warmer Conegliano subzone is a perfect example of its kind.

100334,Spagnol NV Col del Sas Extra Dry (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),This crisp sparkler is characterized by drying mineral tones and delicate aromas of stone fruit and citrus.

100335,Jacquart NV Mosaïque Rosé Brut (Champagne),"A ripe, fruity wine that takes its raspberry flavor from the color. The wine has softness, a creamy character that rounds out any acidity, leaving a smooth, fruity finish.",Jacquart,France,86,42,Champagne Blend
100336,L'Antica Quercia 2007 Arió Extra Dry (Prosecco di Conegliano),"There's a unique note here of mature fruit, chopped basil or peppermint with a hint of spice or chopped white peppercorn. The bubbling seems less frothy and the wine has a flat, big feel in the mouth. Grapes were farmed organically and the wine is from the 2007 vintage, which may explain its distinctive style.",L'Antica Quercia,Italy,86,15,Prosecco
100337,Koyle 2015 Costa Pinot Noir (Colchagua Costa),"Gritty, heavily roasted aromas of peanuts and herbal berry fruits lead to a scratchy, tannic palate. This tastes of burnt oak, raw plum and currant, while the finish tastes briny and harsh. The 2012 version of this wine was much better. This is rough from front to back.",Koyle,Chile,83,35,Pinot Noir
100338,Château Notre Dame du Quatourze 2015 Rosé (Languedoc),"An easy and inviting selection, there's a mentholated streak to the soft red currant and cherry core of this wine. Light and breezy on the palate, it offers thin, quickly dissipating flavors and a fleeting finish.",Château Notre Dame du Quatourze,France,83,16,Rosé
100339,Mémoires 2015 Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence),The wine is earthy and somewhat rustic. There is fruit but it is spoiled by a spicy pepper edge. Chill this drastically.,Mémoires,France,82,11,Rosé

100341,Antoine Moltès & Fils 2015 Tradition Pinot Gris (Alsace),"The nose is muted, despite the slight spritz of the wine, while the palate is equally toned down. It's a rounded if not very expressive white wine.",Antoine Moltès & Fils,France,82,18,Pinot Gris
100342,Pezzi King 2013 Serracino Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Plummy and hinting at black cherry, this wine is otherwise soft and simple, with a distracting, full-throttled descent into raisin cake and prune.",Pezzi King,US,82,48,Zinfandel

100344,Pura 8 2010 Grand Reserve Pinot Noir (Rapel Valley),"Jumpy on the nose at first, but then green tea and grassy aromas take over. This PN is what it is: it tastes grassy, leafy and like green beans. Vegetal notes carry over to the finish.",Pura 8,Chile,81,20,Pinot Noir
100345,Viña Tarapacá 2015 Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Leyda Valley),"Aromas of pumpkin, squash and corn chips are stale and not inviting.

100346,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Rare Muscat (Rutherglen),"This wine contains some material over 100 years old, but shows no signs of fragility. Instead, it's concentrated through age and should hold in the bottle indefinitely. It's dark coffee-brown in color, with delectable aromas of rancio, dried fig, molasses and black tea, yet despite enormous concentration avoids excessive weight. And it's amazingly complex and fresh on the nearly endless finish.",Chambers Rosewood Vineyards,Australia,100,350,Muscat
100347,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Rare Muscadelle (Rutherglen),"This deep brown wine smells like a damp, mossy cave. Then add complex rancio notes, plus maple syrup and molasses.

100348,Robert Weil 2014 Kiedrich Gräfenberg Trockenbeerenauslese Riesling (Rheingau),"Dusty, saffron-spiced earthiness is juxtaposed against intense mango and tangerine fruitiness in this deeply complex wine.

Spry and silken, it finishes on a long lingering whisper of honey and peach.",Robert Weil,Germany,97,775,Riesling
100349,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Grand Muscat (Rutherglen),"Deep mahogany. Dried fig and black tea on the nose, then concentrated mocha and molasses flavors, enlivened by candied orange zest.

100351,Cavallotto 2010 Vignolo Riserva (Barolo),"After a few minutes in the glass, this stunning wine opens up to reveal classic Nebbiolo aromas of leather, tilled soil, underbrush, fragrant blue flower and ripe berry.

Medium-bodied and lush, it will remain on your palate memory a long time.",Rochioli,US,96,68,Chardonnay
100357,Jasper Hill 2013 Georgia's Paddock Shiraz (Heathcote),"Dusty, firm, powerful: just a few apt descriptors for this vintage of one of Heathcote's top wines.

100358,Château de la Tour 2013 Vieilles Vignes (Clos de Vougeot),"Produced from vines more than 100 years old in the heart of the Clos de Vougeot vineyard, this is an impressive wine with a long future.

100359,Weingut Hans Bausch 2011 Hattenheimer Hassel Auslese Riesling (Rheingau),"Intensely fragrant, this honey-sweet auslese wafts of ripe yellow peaches and caramelized sugar. Tropical mango, pineapple and melon collide on the palate before falling neatly in line against a strike of high-toned acidity. The finish is luxuriously long, peppered by a faint dusting of saffron.

100360,Philippe Colin 2014 Les Chenevottes Premier Cru (Chassagne-Montrachet),"Up the slope above the Grand Cru of Le Montrachet, this vineyard once grew hemp (hence the name, cheneve).

100365,Winderlea 2014 Weber Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"For 2014, the Weber is the star of a very fine Winderlea lineup. Dark and deeply concentrated, it's jammed with black cherry fruit, annotated with anise and showing a hint of gunmetal. The tannins are ripe and taste of clean earth. This is a fine candidate for aging. Drink now through 2030.",Winderlea,US,95,48,Pinot Noir
100366,Wakefield 2013 St. Andrews Single Vineyard Release Shiraz (Clare Valley),"The Taylor family selected Clare Valley for its Cabernet affinity, but this Shiraz is a knockout.

100367,Cantina Terlano 2000 Vorberg Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige),"This spends 12 months in oak and it shows: It offers aromas of liquid smoke and flavors of brown sugar, honey and caramel.

100368,De Martino 1999 Reserva de la Familia Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"Aromas of mint, berry syrup and dense, lemony oak lay a good foundation for the heavy black fruit that comes on the palate atop a plush carpet of toasty, fresh-grained wood.

100369,Montresor 2001 Bianco di Custoza,"A plump, juicy mouthful of citrusy fruit, worth trying with grilled or broiled seafood. The zesty lime aromas broaden out on the palate to include orange and tangerine flavors, making it tart but not too tart. Best Buy.",Montresor,Italy,88,11,Garganega

100377,Volpe Pasini 2002 Zuc de Volpe Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"A well-judged, well-structured wine that balances fresh, crisp and light fruit against flavors of peaches, almonds and cinnamon. It will be better in two or three years' time.",Volpe Pasini,Italy,88,18,Pinot Grigio

100381,Lapostolle 2002 Estate Bottled Merlot (Rapel Valley),"At first this is aggressive, with an aromatic note of wet dog along with blueberries. But soon it finds its legs and opens to display chocolate, espresso and a big batch of black plum and blackberry. The finish has full tannins and some coffee-like flavor. Currently it's wall-to-wall big, but it should settle down in no time and become a good red to drink on any occasion.",Lapostolle,Chile,88,12,Merlot
100382,Fratelli Zeni 2000 Vigne Alte (Bianco di Custoza),It's testament to this wine's balance that it remains so alive and fresh long after many other Biancos have faded.

100389,Kynsi 1999 Paragon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Delicate and complex, a cool climate wine with a mixture of ripe cherry flavors and leaner ones of tobacco, tomato skin, and cranberry.

Editors' Choice.",Cantina Terlano,Italy,88,15,White Blend
100391,Casa Julia 2001 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Right off the bat this wine is pure and smooth. The nose is pretty, with cranberry and cassis.

100398,Cono Sur 2008 Visión Pinot Noir (Colchagua Valley),"Fresh aromas of red cherry and light berry fruit precede a palate that runs a little racy, with borderline tart plum and pie cherry flavors.

100399,Aresti 2008 Estate Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),"On the plump but balanced side, with a perfumed nose that's almost sweet for SB.

Decent quality; will get the job done.",Aresti,Chile,85,13,Sauvignon Blanc
100400,Astoria 2008 Extra Dry (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),"The wine starts off slowly due to a note of almond nut or cardboard that masks the natural fruit. Once it gets started, however, this luminous sparkling Prosecco offers cheerful notes of stone fruit and pear.",Astoria,Italy,85,24,Prosecco
100401,Cantine Maschio NV Brut Prosecco (Italy),"Tonic and lean with a nearly transparent color and lively perlage, this non-DOC Prosecco offers candy-like aromas of butterscotch and lemon soda.

100493,Zerba Cellars 2008 Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Tart and lively, this medium-bodied Sangiovese was co-fermented with small amounts of Syrah and Viognier. The Viognier contributes scents of citrus and stone fruit, which add some welcome complexity.",Zerba Cellars,US,87,30,Sangiovese
100494,Insania 2009 Red (Red Mountain),"Produced by Three Rivers for celebrity winemaker Geoff Tate, the Insania is actually rather tame. Pretty fruit flavors of berry, cherry and plum introduce the wine gracefully, then run into some stiff, drying, chalky tannins.",Insania,US,87,35,Red Blend

100515,Cono Sur 2012 20 Barrels Limited Edition Peralillo Estate Merlot (Colchagua Valley),"Baked blueberry and boysenberry aromas are more ripe than delicate.

Drink through 2023.",Cono Sur,Chile,91,35,Merlot
100516,D.R.

The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet.

100524,Ruby 2015 Steve's Reserve Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"There's a whiff of volatility upon opening, then a rush of bright, tangy orange and cherry fruit. The 20% new oak aging does not really come through in scent or flavor. Though not in any way effervescent, this young release carries an impression of carbonation in the finish.

100529,Jeaunaux-Robin NV Brut Zéro Sélection (Champagne),"This producer shows its preference for dry Champagnes with this bone-dry, oak-fermented bottling.

100533,Le Cadeau 2015 Diversité Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) consults here. This brings a blend of clones from the estate vineyard, with ample new wood still showing through. Black fruits and a vein of coffee are also in the mix, with a balanced, somewhat muscular mouthfeel.

100534,Le Cadeau 2015 Équinoxe Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch. Black coffee, black cherry, black olive and black licorice are entwined here, with some heat in the follow-through.

100576,Château de l'Aubrade 2015 Bordeaux Supérieur,"This is a juicy wine with its red fruits and attractive acidity.

100577,Château de Pressac 2014 Les Terrasses de Pressac (Saint-Émilion),"From a Grand Cru estate, this second wine shows the same rich fruit and generous structure as the winery's first wine.

100608,Quady North 2011 Steel-Ox Viognier (Rogue Valley),"Named after the blending of Steelhead Run and Ox vineyard blocks, this appealing wine is fresh and varietal with notes of ripe peach and herbs.

100611,Rodney Strong 2012 Charlotte's Home Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Northern Sonoma),"A touch of oak adds a sweet, smoky creaminess to this wine, but it's really dominated by Sauvignon Blanc's acidity and racy spearmint and tropical fruit.

100617,B Cellars 2011 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This Chardonnay wants time to warm and breathe in the glass, so don't pour it right from the fridge. After a little while it develops considerably in generosity, offering waves of tropical fruits, peaches and pears. The oak is pretty strong, even jarring.

100630,Walt 2013 Pinpoint Extreme Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Each year, this wine is intended to be an experiment. This vintage's creativity involves the addition of soil from the Santa Rita Hills to vineyards in the Russian River Valley.

100632,Willm 2011 Vendanges Tardives Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Lifted notes of honey and rose petal play on the nose, the palate is altogether more lively than the nose suggests: sprightly and fresh, concentrated and caramel-tinged with lemon freshness. This strikes an appetizing, moreish palate and makes for joyful drinking.",Willm,France,92,54,Gewürztraminer
100633,Jean-Marc Bernhard 2013 Wineck-Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Ripe fragrant, yellow mirabelle plums constitute the chief perfume of this charming wine.

100637,Torbreck 2010 The Factor Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"The Torbreck wines, with the emphasis they place on ripeness, can sometimes be controversial. This one is full bodied and rich, with dense plum and chocolate notes that verge on being fudge-like. But those elements are lifted slightly by hints of mint and bacon.

100638,Biecher & Schaal 2014 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru White (Alsace),"A rather perfumed nose hints at the Gewurztraminer that colors this Riesling with rose petal and honeysuckle notes. The co-planted varieties in this vineyard make a smashing duo since they are almost polar opposites: structured, straight-laced Riesling with its fine spine of acidity benefits from the playfulness and charm of aromatic, fleshy Gewurztraminer which in turn is lit up by Riesling's freshness. Really, this is a case where you can have the best of both worlds.",Biecher & Schaal,France,92,45,Alsace white blend

100641,Foxen 2014 Tinaquaic Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Yields tend to be low in this dry-farmed vineyard, which especially struggles during a drought, but the quality is fantastic.

100648,Quinta do Monte Xisto 2013 Red (Douro),"This is an impressive, powerful wine. It speaks of the hard landscape of the Douro Superior, with its structure and dark tannins. At the same time, ripe dark fruits push through the still-young tannins giving the potential for a rich, black fruit dominated wine.

100686,Cobb 2012 Emmaline Ann Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine pushes the notion of low alcohol, giving soft and subtle an extreme definition. As such, it will not please everyone.

100687,Comm. G. B. Burlotto 2011 Acclivi (Barolo),"This opens with aromas of underbrush, leather, berry and a balsamic note.

100691,Nittnaus Hans und Christine 2013 Nit'ana Red (Burgenland),"Still closed, this is redolent of the elegant, nutty notes of new French oak which nonetheless complement the ripe but supple cherry fruit. The tannins are superfine and the addition of peppery Zweigelt to this Cabernet-Merlot blend lends spice and verve to the mix.

100723,Mendel 2015 Semillon (Mendoza),"Mushy citrus and papaya aromas are waxy and lack pop. Angular and lemony in feel, this varietal white offers a one-note flavor profile based on lemon. A ringing, citric finish affords for a hint of tropical fruit.",Mendel,Argentina,85,25,Sémillon

100729,Terrazas de Los Andes 2015 Reserva Torrontés (Salta),"Initial aromas of lychee and jasmine are varietally correct but this struggles to stay fresh and instead turns oily on the nose.

100740,Marchesi di Barolo 2009 Riserva (Barolo),"Roasted coffee bean and menthol aromas lead the nose while the evolved palate offers dark bitter chocolate, licorice and a toasted note.

100744,Pech Merle 2013 Treborce Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Ripe plum and plenty of vanilla and cherry provide the perception of sweetness in this wine.

100777,Pierre Gimonnet et Fils 2005 Oenophile Premier Cru Blanc de Blancs Extra Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"The extra age on this bone-dry wine has paid off, as the taut character of a young wine has been tempered with toast, creating a round feeling.

100849,Domaine Collotte 2014 Clos de Jeu (Marsannay),"With tannins and new-wood flavors, this rich wine is also structured. A smoky character from the wood is shot through by perfumed red fruits.

Medium-grained tannins give the finish some gravitas.",Bergevin Lane,US,90,58,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
100894,Hungerford Hill 2008 Heavy Metal Shiraz (South Eastern Australia),"This is an unusually complex Shiraz for the price, ably marrying meaty-savory notes with tart berries and plenty of weight on the palate.

100897,Leonesse Cellars 2007 Signature Selection Syrah (Temecula Valley),"Aged a little more than two years in 90% new French oak and then in bottle, time has been kind to this wine, a Syrah of dark mushroom and baked blackberry, that's savory and silky with a slight hint of mint on the finish.

100898,Market Vineyards 2008 Dividend Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Dusty and tight, with a whiff of coffee and cocoa introducing an elegant wine with interesting streaks of metal and graphite.

100900,Mazzei 2009 Fonterutoli (Chianti Classico),"Tuscany's Mazzei family delivers a wonderful Chianti Classico from their Fonterutoli estate that would pair perfectly with grilled meats or oven-roasted pasta.

100901,Morlanda 2007 Criança Red (Priorat),"It has taken a few years but Morlanda has reached a nice place with this wine.

100903,Becker 2014 Reserve Bingham Vineyard Roussanne (Texas High Plains),"White lily, popcorn kernel, citrus spray and underripe peach lead the well-integrated and restrained nose.

100904,Bex 2014 Riesling (Nahe),"Whiffs of smoke and nuts mingle into tart tangerine and lime flavors in this refreshing off-dry Riesling. Juicy and fresh, it's a straightforward, revitalizing sip. Drink now through 2018.",Bex,Germany,87,10,Riesling
100905,Boffa 2013 Pajè (Barbaresco),"Aromas of leather, vineyard dust, dried violet and a whiff of pressed powder lead the nose.

100911,Antucura 2011 Grand Vin Red (Vista Flores),"Flat in color, with a dull luster, this smells mulchy and earthy, with dampness to the nose.

100920,Domaine Bousquet 2015 Reserve Pinot Gris (Tupungato),"Despite looking gold and mature, this PG exceeds expectations courtesy of waxy, baked-apple aromas and a full but balanced mouthfeel. Spiced apple, apricot and burnt orange flavors finish long due to core acidity. Drink immediately.",Domaine Bousquet,Argentina,87,15,Pinot Gris

100926,Terre Rouge 2013 Vin Doux Naturel Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"An earthy, nutty aroma and flavor come through the intense sweetness and full body of this dessert-style wine. It goes for earthy complexity rather than obvious fruit flavors, and tastes high in sugar and alcohol.",Terre Rouge,US,87,20,Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains
100927,Antonio Mas 2011 Roll Fermentor Malbec (Tupungato),"This Malbec is a collection of disparate parts that doesn't justify its price.

100931,Bodega Calle 2014 Alberti 154 Malbec (Mendoza),"Roasted, woodsy, rubbery aromas are gamy and staunch, with berry notes interspersed. Grabby, rubbery tannins make for a rugged palate, while roasted plum and gamy flavors are a touch salty. A tannic finish doesn't change much.",Bodega Calle,Argentina,87,15,Malbec
100932,Borgogno F.lli Serio e Battista 2012 Barolo,"Berry, menthol and a hint of espresso aromas lead the way while the straightforward palate shows mature black-skinned berry, coffee and a hint of licorice.

100933,Château les Petits Arnauds 2014 Tradition (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"The wood flavors are still prominent in this spicy wine.

100934,Château Mougneaux 2014 Bordeaux Supérieur,"While the wine is firm and tannic at this early stage, it does have the potential to bring out a more fruity character.

100935,Château Saintongey 2014 Vieilles Vignes (Bordeaux),"Ripe fruit and balanced acidity allow this wine to make room for touches of wood aging.

100936,Château Ségonzac 2014 Vieilles Vignes (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"From a estate in the Marmet family since 1990, the wine has ripe Merlot flavors that give a generous character.

100937,Chehalem 2013 Ian's Reserve Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This is surprisingly light, having dropped significantly in alcohol from the previous vintage. Green-fruit flavors touch on banana and apple, and the wood—31% new and 26% once-used—seems to show a bit of rawness. Give this another couple of years of bottle age before opening.",Chehalem,US,87,40,Chardonnay
100938,Chehalem 2015 Stoller Vineyards Pinot Blanc (Dundee Hills),"This is a pleasant white wine, albeit rather generic, as Pinot Blanc is prone to be.

100939,Covila 2013 II Crianza (Rioja),"Earthy, cool aromas of wet cement, raisin and raspberry are a bit flat. This feels drawing and tannic, with flavors of tomato, red plum, currant and raspberry. A full-size finish is comfortable but not very complex.",Covila,Spain,87,15,Tempranillo

100943,Ektimo Vineyards 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Stewy plum and cherry jam lie at the heart of this densely layered, though silky-smooth wine, light bodied and ethereal despite the ripeness of fruit flavor. It finishes simply and without fuss.",Ektimo Vineyards,US,87,34,Pinot Noir
100944,Finca del Marquesado 2013 Crianza (Rioja),"Slightly gritty aromas are just barely ripe enough. This feels tight, acidic and like tomato juice.

100945,Folin Cellars 2015 Estate Viognier (Rogue Valley),"Sharply defined, this has piercing, penetrating high notes that are both floral and fruity. Its lemon and tangerine fruit is amped up with some alcoholic burn. Aerating it helps to smooth it out.",Folin Cellars,US,87,27,Viognier

100947,Frank Family 2013 Reserve Winston Hill Vineyard Sangiovese (Rutherford),"Small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah are blended within this wine, given 17 months in new French oak plus once and twice-used barrels.

100948,Real Companhia Velha 2014 Evel Tinto Red (Douro),"Just lightly touched by wood this is a bright and fruity wine that is ready to drink. Spice and red-berry fruits dominate, lifted by balanced tannins. Drink now.",Real Companhia Velha,Portugal,87,13,Portuguese Red
100949,Santos & Seixo 2014 Santos da Casa Tinto Red (Alentejano),"It is the 30% Alicante Bouschet in the blend that gives the dense color to this ripe wine.

100953,Agustí Torelló Mata 2015 XIC Xarel-lo (Penedès),"Dusty stone-fruit aromas suggest yeast and nectarine. This varietal Xarel-lo feels citrusy and spunky; flavors of melon, orange and nectarine are good but standard on the finish. Overall, this is linear and fairly basic for white wine.",Agustí Torelló Mata,Spain,87,16,Xarel-lo
100954,Amalie Robert 2012 i Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This new “i” series offering mixes brambly strawberry fruit with granular tannins. It's ready to drink, dappled with cinnamon, and leaves a slightly medicinal aftertaste in the back of the mouth.",Amalie Robert,US,87,38,Pinot Noir

100956,Bersano 2012 Nirvasco (Barolo),"This offers scents and flavors that recall stewed prune, raisin and black pepper. It's still tight, with aggressive tannins that leave a firm clenching finish.

100958,Carica 2015 Ritchie Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"The great Ritchie Vineyard, a renowned site for Chardonnay, also possesses highly sought-after Sauvignon Blanc.

100959,Ignacio Marín 2015 Wine Wings Garnacha Rosé (Cariñena),"Crisp plum and red-bell-pepper aromas lead to a healthy, mostly fresh palate with some weight to it.

100960,Jacquart NV Brut Mosaïque (Champagne),"Partially from Grand Cru vineyards in the Montagne de Reims and the Côte des Blancs, this wine is soft, ripe and balanced, with a ripe dosage that contrasts with citrus acidity. It has a fine, cool texture.",Jacquart,France,87,40,Champagne Blend
100961,Château Cap Saint-Martin 2014 Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"This is a fragrant, spicy wine that is shot through with red fruits and fine acidity.

100966,Vinosia 2006 Vecchie Vigne (Primitivo di Manduria),"Packaged in a heavy, oversized black bottle, this brawny wine delivers power, bulging muscle and aromas that exaggerate in every way possible. The most noticeable feature (so noticeable, it knocks you in the face) is the wood element that comes off as fresh carpentry or wood shavings. The wine is heavy, syrupy and sweet tasting.",Vinosia,Italy,85,48,Primitivo
100967,Kono 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"The 2004 and 2005 vintages of this wine were priced at $15, which gives some idea how fast the supply of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc has increased.

100976,Feudo Montoni 2008 P Pinot Noir (Sicilia),"Fabio Sireci is behind some of Sicily's best Nero d'Avola and has more recently decided to flex his winemaker muscle on Pinot Noir. The results are a tad jammy and muddled (his vineyards are smack in the middle of the Mediterranean island), ending with ripe aromas of prune and raisin.",Feudo Montoni,Italy,85,12,Pinot Noir
100977,Kendall-Jackson 2008 Summation Vintner's Reserve White (California),"Clean and crisp, with rich flavors of citrus, pear, green apple, vanilla and honey. Finishes with that well-known K-J sweetness. A blend based on Sauvignon Blanc.",Kendall-Jackson,US,85,17,White Blend
100978,Ledgewood Creek 2007 Estate Grown Viognier (Suisun Valley),"Sweet and simple, with pleasantly exotic flavors of pineapples, green apples, pears, honeysuckle flowers, minerals, spices, vanilla, brown sugar and smoky oak. Easy to drink.",Ledgewood Creek,US,85,16,Viognier
100979,X 2008 White X White (North Coast),"A little on the sweet side, but crisp in acidity, and front-loaded with pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, honeysuckle and spicy vanilla flavors. Sauvignon Blanc, Muscat Blanc, Chardonnay and Roussanne.",X,US,85,15,White Blend
100980,Château Lamothe-Vincent 2008 Sauvignon (Bordeaux Blanc),"A heavy dose of Sauvignon Blanc brings herbaceous, grassy, white currants and gooseberry flavors. It's young, and needs more time to coalesce. It is certainly fresh, fruity, right up front.",Château Lamothe-Vincent,France,85,10,Sauvignon Blanc
100981,Montresor 2003 Capitel della Crosara (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"This wine doesn't seem to have fully evolved and its aromas are muddled in places with notes of mature fruit and natural rubber. In the mouth it has red fruit flavors and tight tannins, but it generally lacks definition.",Montresor,Italy,85,41,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
100982,Yvon Mau 2007 Premius Bordeaux Sauvignon (Bordeaux Blanc),"This totally fresh wine has benefited from the quality of whites in 2007 Bordeaux. It is lemony with pink grapefruit flavors giving an intense lift. There is some herbaceousness, with green herbs and juicy fruits. To drink now.",Yvon Mau,France,85,10,Sauvignon Blanc
100983,Bellenda 2005 Col di Luna Cabernet Sauvignon (Piave),"This is a northern Italian Cabernet with a light, informal style and low intensity. The wine delivers measured aromas of cherry, pine, cedar and ends with a crisp note of acidity.",Bellenda,Italy,85,16,Cabernet Sauvignon
100984,Breggo 2008 Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley),"Off-dry, with sugary flavors of apricots, pears, flowers, vanilla and dusty Asian spices. Crisp acidity provides needed balance. Try with Vietnamese, Thai or Burmese fare.",Breggo,US,85,25,Gewürztraminer
100985,Byzantium 2005 Rosso di Valachia Red (Dealu Mare),"An intriguing nose of tobacco, mint, cherry and spice leads this earthy red. Flavors of spice, tobacco, red berry and tea are supported by ageable tannins and good complexity.",Byzantium,Romania,85,12,Red Blend
100986,Pascual Toso 2007 Reserve Las Barrancas Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Coconut and dill aromas rise from the nose, and they are surrounded by berry, cassis and floral scents. The palate is tight, honest and a little hard, with middle-of-the-road berry flavors tinged with herbs. There's size and power to this wine, but also balance. Compared to previous years, it's a little less generous but still a good way to go.",Pascual Toso,Argentina,88,20,Cabernet Sauvignon
100987,Quinta de la Rosa 2004 Late Bottled Vintage (Port),"This is a sweet, rich Port. Its aromas are of soft berry jelly, with a ripe herbal character. To taste, it is concentrated, but the sweetness of the fruit masks its density. Berry and dried fruits make an attractive blend, leaving a firmer structure in the aftertaste.",Quinta de la Rosa,Portugal,88,,Port
100988,Sieber Rd 2007 Viognier (Barossa Valley),"While lacking the vibrant fruit typical of the variety, there are some attractive hay and honey scents on nose. The full-bodied and soft-textured palate is cloaked in vanilla, which lingers on the finish.",Sieber Rd,Australia,88,25,Viognier
100989,Lachini 2007 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"This is a classic, high-acid vintage. The strength is fruit, and it's a mix of citrus and light pineapple; all stainless fermented and finished at moderate alcohol. Quite different in style from the '06, but well-made.",Lachini,US,88,20,Pinot Gris
100990,Mauro 2005 Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"Mauro will always show you a lot, but frankly this 2005 seems soft and chunky. It has rich, baked, black-fruit aromas and then a mildly syrupy palate with huge blackberry and cassis flavors. The finish is wide and rich, but where are the tannins and structure that this wine is known for? Drink now for best results; it may not improve in the cellar. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Mauro,Spain,88,53,Tempranillo Blend
100991,Dancing Bull 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"Good price for a crisp white wine that's this polished. Nice on its own for the savory citrus, spearmint and spicy vanilla flavors, and fine with everything from fried chicken to Cantonese.",Dancing Bull,US,88,12,Sauvignon Blanc
100992,Domaine de Mirail 2005 Les Mirlandes Red (Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne),"A remarkably rich, spicy, attractive red. It obviously has new wood, but its use is judicious, leaving the mint, black berry and soft tannins of the fruit to come through well.",Domaine de Mirail,France,88,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
100993,Domaine des Terrisses 2006 Grande Tradition Red (Gaillac),"Made from Fer Servadou, Duras and Syrah, this is a wine with a truly local pedigree and a modern style, with prominent new wood. There are aromas that talk of wild heather and a dry landscape and palate notes of spice, ripe berries and prunes.",Domaine des Terrisses,France,88,14,Red Blend
100994,Domaine du Tariquet 2007 Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay (Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne),"A delicious wine, the Chenin Blanc giving both mineral and spice flavors, contrasting with the richer Chardonnay. Apricot and sweet melon flavors are supported by a fine, surprisingly complex structure. Fresh currants mark the refreshing finish.",Domaine du Tariquet,France,88,12,Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay
100995,Fournier Père et Fils 2006 Les Belles Vignes (Sancerre),"An enticingly perfumed wine, with its white flowers and apricot blossom. The palate is soft, rich, moving towards yellow fruits, ripe pink grapefruit and just an edge of mineral chalkiness.",Fournier Père et Fils,France,88,22,Sauvignon Blanc
100996,Benanti 2006 Edèlmio White (Sicilia),"Edèlmio is a sophisticated and toasty blend of Carricante and Chardonnay with fragrant aromas of stone fruit, peach, mineral, almond and freshly chopped pear. The wine is broad and generous in terms of its mouthfeel and would make a perfect companion to swordfish with mint and roasted eggplant.",Benanti,Italy,88,26,White Blend
100997,Caruso & Minini 2006 Terre di Giumara Syrah (Sicilia),"Here's a Syrah with bursting aromas of mature blueberry, cherry, spice and smoked bacon. The wine is full, round and generous with a supple feel and soft concentration. Pair it with lamb or roasted pork.",Caruso & Minini,Italy,88,14,Syrah
100998,Yalumba 2006 Patchwork Shiraz (Barossa),"Blended from a patchwork of old vineyards throughout the Barossa, this is typical Barossa Shiraz, with plenty of weight and creamy tannins that support plummy, chocolaty fruit. There's a bit of spice for complexity and a crisp, fresh finish. Drink now–2014.",Yalumba,Australia,88,18,Shiraz
100999,The Four Graces 2007 Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills),"Rich in the mouth, this creamy and textural wine mixes fruit flavors of peach, apple and pear in equal proportion. It's a bit heavier than the previous vintage, with less of the floral character, but it offers, instead, a richness that lingers into a satisfying finish.",The Four Graces,US,88,18,Pinot Gris
101000,Amity 2006 Riesling (Willamette Valley),"Creamy and textural, this brings on a nice mix of apple, pear and Key lime fruit flavors, fresh and pretty. Just a hint of minerality adds interest to the finish.",Amity,US,88,17,Riesling
101001,Arcane Cellars 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rogue Valley),"Arcane's Cab is stylistically apart from either California or Washington. It defines its own space. There's plenty of new oak, but the fruit, acid and tannins stand up to it. This is sharp and tangy; cranberry and raspberry, strawberry and citric acids all playing their part. Still young, give it some time in a decanter or in your cellar to come together and show its best.",Arcane Cellars,US,88,24,Cabernet Sauvignon
101002,Benanti 2005 Il Monovitigno (Etna),"Nerello Mascalese, a grape native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna, delivers fresh berry notes that recall raspberry, blueberry and mulberry backed by toasted almond. There are pretty mineral nuances woven within its texture and the wine ends with polished tannins and menthol freshness. It is aged 12 months in oak, but you hardly taste the wood.",Benanti,Italy,88,41,Nerello Mascalese
101003,Benton-Lane 2006 First Class Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Aromas of cherry, spice and mint lead into tart pie cherry and wild berry fruit, dusted with cocoa and spiced up with 16 months in French oak barrels. Unusual for most high-end Pinots, this is sealed with a screwcap.",Benton-Lane,US,88,60,Pinot Noir
101004,Château Puy-Servain 2003 Vieilles Vignes (Montravel),The richness of vintage 2003 shows in this wine's layers of dried fruits on top of sweet tannins and a dense concentration. There is some licorice flavor arriving as the wine matures.,Château Puy-Servain,France,88,26,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101005,Château Puy-Servain 2007 Marjolaine (Montravel),"Full, firm white wine that gives good green fruit and pear flavors, lifted with spice from wood. The wine is round, while still retaining crispness from grassy acidity, and offers a good depth of plum skin structure and flavor.",Château Puy-Servain,France,88,25,Bordeaux-style White Blend
101006,Domaine Philippe Portier 2007 Quincy,"A full, soft Sauvignon from close to Sancerre. There is a light, yeasty character to this young wine, but the fruit is all there—fresh pink grapefruit, lime and green berries. The finish is acidic and crisp, but still mouth-filling.",Domaine Philippe Portier,France,88,16,Sauvignon Blanc
101007,Expression 44° 2006 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"This bold, expressive Pinot Noir bursts open with spice, herb and leaf then rolls into flavors of vanilla cream and tangy red fruits. The spicy elements wrap into all the other flavors, giving lift and life; this is an exciting wine, though not necessarily one to cellar.",Expression 44°,US,88,40,Pinot Noir
101008,Fournier Père et Fils 2006 Les Caillottes (Pouilly-Fumé),"Concentrated, with white fruits, a strong streak of herbaceousness, green apples and a rich texture. The wine shows intensity as well as youth. It really needs another year before drinking.",Fournier Père et Fils,France,88,21,Sauvignon Blanc
101009,Nick Faldo 2005 Shiraz (Coonawarra),"Intense and focused, this good value Coonawarra opens with notes of leather and polished wood overlaid with red-berry fruit. Tannins are smooth, but there's plenty of lip-smacking acidity to keep the cherry cordial and plum fruit flavors lively. Drink now. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Nick Faldo,Australia,88,14,Shiraz
101010,Tarapaca 2006 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Denser and less herbal than the 2005 Gran Reserva, with fresh cassis and plum fruit to go with some chocolaty overtones. This has plenty of intensity and structure.",Tarapaca,Chile,88,18,Cabernet Sauvignon
101011,The Four Graces 2005 Black Family Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This is a very interesting wine. It has many different flavor threads that have not quite interwoven. To begin there is a surplus of acid, leaving a chalky sensation that has not yet smoothed out. The fruit flavors are also sharp and tart—red fruits from wild berries to pomegranate to sour cherry. The aromas suggest some light chocolate from the barrel aging, and it shows up in the finish, along with herb and vanilla. So, there's lots going on, but it has not yet come together in a harmonious whole.",The Four Graces,US,88,75,Pinot Noir
101012,Hunt Country Vineyards 2007 Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),"Unusually fruity for a Pinot Gris, this bursts with quince, hay and lanolin aromas that give way to an intense palate with good weight. While slightly astringent, the mouthwatering finish will provide a good foil for fried calamari.",Hunt Country Vineyards,US,88,16,Pinot Gris
101013,Antichi Vinai 1877 2013 Pietralava Red (Etna),"This ruby-hued blend of Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio conveys aromas of bright berry, intense mint and a whiff of baking spice. The vibrant palate offers sour cherry, mineral and cinnamon flavors alongside fresh acidity.",Antichi Vinai 1877,Italy,88,,Red Blend
101014,Baglio di Pianetto 2007 Cembali Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),"Aromas suggest oak, vanilla, bell pepper and cassis. The palate offers black cherry, cranberry, vanilla, mocha and oak alongside astringent, drying tannins.",Baglio di Pianetto,Italy,88,45,Nero d'Avola
101015,Brecon Estate 2012 Forty Two Red (Paso Robles),"This blend from a newer Westside Paso winery offers blackberry, charred pine and sour cherry aromas. The palate is driven by pine sap, charred game and sharp herbs such as oregano and rosemary, and would be a great way to spice up a steak dinner.",Brecon Estate,US,88,42,Rhône-style Red Blend
101016,Callaway 2010 Profonde Winemaker's Reserve Red (Temecula Valley),"A nice tarry funk along with dried mint and menthol cigarette scents characterize the nose of this blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Syrah and 4% Petite Verdot. The creosote sense carries to the palate, meeting with black cherry, dried bouquet garni and quite grippy tannins.",Callaway,US,88,48,Red Blend
101017,Casa di Grazia 2011 Gradiva Collectio Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),"Aromas of ripe dark berry, blue flower and a hint of baking spice waft from the glass. On the palate, notes of graphite, licorice and touch of smoke add depth to the ripe black cherry flavors. Firm tannins provide support.",Casa di Grazia,Italy,88,22,Nero d'Avola
101018,Casa di Grazia 2013 Zahara Grillo (Sicilia),"Citrus, yellow apple, orange blossom and saline aromas take center stage. On the palate, notes of savory herb accent creamy apple and pear flavors that are brightened by fresh acidity and a mineral note.",Casa di Grazia,Italy,88,22,Grillo
101019,Ruhlmann 2013 Vieilles Vignes Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"This wine is still young, showing spice and not yet enough fruit. It has the right weight and potential richness as well as concentration from the old vines. Drink this ageworthy wine from 2016.",Ruhlmann,France,88,20,Gewürztraminer
101020,Spring Mountain Vineyard 2011 Elivette Red (Napa Valley),"Estate bottled, this assemblage of 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot opens with a flurry of coconut flake and herb, followed by ripe, rich layers of dark berry and black tea. The wine has power yet also possesses an elegance that stands out, finishing with a taste of dark caramel.",Spring Mountain Vineyard,US,88,125,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101021,Stanton Vineyard 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Creamy and fresh, this is made from estate-grown grapes, fermented in a mix of stainless steel and neutral barrels. The fruit flavors blend jicama, melon and pear, with a touch of sweetness. It finishes with a hint of honeysuckle.",Stanton Vineyard,US,88,14,Pinot Gris
101022,Terrazas de Los Andes 2012 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),"Warm, earthy, jammy berry aromas are oaky and bring a note of latex into the fold. This chunky Malbec is tannic and grabby, with oaky flavors of black plum and vanilla set against herbal undertones. Spice, chocolate, carob and drawing tannins create a bold but rough finish.",Terrazas de Los Andes,Argentina,88,20,Malbec
101023,Cusumano 2013 Cubia Tenuta Ficuzza Insolia (Sicilia),"Made entirely with Insolia, this opens with subdued aromas of tropical fruit and white spring flower. The bright, linear palate offers passion fruit, peach, nectarine zest and a hint of ginger alongside crisp acidity.",Cusumano,Italy,88,27,Insolia
101024,Dalton 2013 Alma Semillon-Viognier-Pinot Gris White (Galilee),"This offers aromas of honeydew melon and vanilla. On the palate, gentle flavors of nutmeg, cinnamon and eucalyptus predominate over a bright burst of citrus. Tannins are a tad bold for a relatively delicate white wine, but they are tempered by baking spice flavors that wash across the tongue and notes of tangerine on the back palate.",Dalton,Israel,88,25,White Blend
101025,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2012 Pfleck Pinot Gris (Alsace),"The Pfleck vineyard with its clay and limestone soil gives a rich style of Pinot Gris. This wine, with its intense spice and lychee flavors, is typical. It has a crisp edge but the ripe fruitiness and touch of pepper give weight and richness. Drink now.",Domaine Barmès-Buecher,France,88,28,Pinot Gris
101026,Dragonette 2012 Vogelzang Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"This is a softer Sauvignon Blanc for those not sworn to the grassy side of the grape, as the Buellton-based winery does a lot of barrel-fermenting. Aromas include pressed kiwi and a sour pucker of lime, and the broiled pear flavors prove easy drinking, if not exceedingly complex.",Dragonette,US,88,42,Sauvignon Blanc
101027,Firesteed 2013 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"Smooth-drinking, this offers soft, mellow flavors of melon and pear. Light but persistent, it's a clean, fresh and appealing selection, best enjoyed now.",Firesteed,US,88,13,Pinot Gris
101028,Folin Cellars 2012 Estate Grenache (Rogue Valley),"The pretty fruit flavors suggest relatively young vines, bringing light cherry to the front and center. Hints of marzipan, a flash of finishing heat and subtle chalkiness run through the finish. Another year or two of bottle age should continue to improve this one.",Folin Cellars,US,88,34,Grenache
101029,Gaba do Xil 2012 Mencía (Valdeorras),"This lighter-bodied Mencía from Valdeorras shows exotic, minerally aromas of raspberry, blueberry and Middle Eastern spices. The palate runs crisp and fresh, but not real deep or intense. Flavors of raspberry, plum and schist finish dry and floral, with a touch of lasting oak.",Gaba do Xil,Spain,88,19,Mencía
101030,Gorka Izagirre 2013 White (Bizkaiko Txakolina),"Clean, peachy aromas set up a light, minerally, citrusy body. Flavors of gooseberry, lime and lemon hold steady and double up on gooseberry on the finish. Overall, this is round, minerally and elegant, but also slightly sour and edgy.",Gorka Izagirre,Spain,88,18,White Blend
101031,Grgich Hills 2012 Miljenko's Selection Chardonnay (Carneros),"There's a substantial earthiness to this Chardonnay, grown in a relatively cool estate vineyard. Vibrant on the palate in ripe apple and lemon, it offers medium weight and body, with a crispness to the finish and a food-friendly nature.",Grgich Hills,US,88,60,Chardonnay
101032,Linaje Garsea 2010 Crianza (Ribera del Duero),"Leathery cherry and cassis aromas are softened up by baking spice accents. In the mouth, this is hard-edged and pointed, with sharp, lemony acidity. Flavors of spiced plum and pie cherry finish with jagged acids and heat. This is a real enamel-peeler; more time in bottle can only help.",Linaje Garsea,Spain,88,28,Tempranillo
101033,Omaka Springs 2013 Pinot Gris (Marlborough),"This is a soft, slightly sweet rendering of Pinot Gris, loaded with succulent pear, pineapple and melon fruit. Chill it well and sip it by the pool this summer.",Omaka Springs,New Zealand,88,16,Pinot Gris
101034,Ventana 2013 Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),"Sea salt, Bosc pear, apple cider, squeezed lemon and shreds of vanilla frame a leaner nose on this wine from mid-Monterey County. The cider element carries to the rather pungent palate, proving quite high-toned and acidic with some minerality, grapefruit peel grip and long-lasting vibrancy on the finish.",Ventana,US,88,22,Chardonnay
101035,Vieil Armand 2010 Clos de la Tourelle Château Ollwiller Pinot Blanc (Alsace),"With its few years of aging, this is now a ripe and broad wine rich in yellow fruits that are cut with pear juice. It has nutty overtones, and a bright, crisp aftertaste.",Vieil Armand,France,88,10,Pinot Blanc
101036,Viticultori Associati Canicatti 2012 Aquilae Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane),"This juicy, delicious red features aromas of red berry, Mediterranean brush and aromatic herb. The easygoing palate doles out ripe blackberry, crushed Morello cherry, a charred note and a touch of baking spice alongside smooth, supple tannins. Enjoy soon to capture the succulent fruit.",Viticultori Associati Canicatti,Italy,88,12,Nero d'Avola
101037,Vivera 2010 Salisire Bianco (Etna),"An attractive fragrance of white flower, stone fruit, apple and a whiff of smoke opens this linear wine. The bright palate offers dried citrus, Golden Delicious apple and mineral alongside brisk acidity.",Vivera,Italy,88,28,Carricante
101038,WildAire 2012 Spofford Station Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"This wine offers notes of toasted vanilla bean, herbs and red fruit. It's broad in feel while the fruit flavors are elegant in style, with the supple feel bringing much of the enjoyment.",WildAire,US,88,28,Syrah
101039,Mills Reef 2012 Gimblett Gravels Reserve Merlot-Malbec (Hawke's Bay),"This lacks a bit of midpalate richness, but otherwise offers fine drinking. Clove, cinnamon and leather complexities keep the cherry flavors interesting, while the finish is clean and crisp. Drink now.",Mills Reef,New Zealand,87,20,Merlot-Malbec
101040,Pazo Torrado 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Varietally correct aromas of peach and melon form a good opening to this mostly fresh but fading Albariño. Flavors of melon, papaya and peach are typical for the grape, and the finish is holding on but showing signs of maturation. Drink immediately.",Pazo Torrado,Spain,87,15,Albariño
101041,Sur de los Andes 2012 Clásico Malbec (Mendoza),"Dark in color and forcefully oaked on the nose, this resiny Malbec will appeal to fans of richly styled reds. Plum, berry, tomato leaf and herbal flavors finish woody but fair, with lasting acidity.",Sur de los Andes,Argentina,87,15,Malbec
101042,Babich 2011 The Patriarch Premium Red (Hawke's Bay),"In marked contrast to the plush, sexy 2010, the 2011 Patriarch is a stern taskmaster. The aromas and flavors of cherry, cedar and dried herbs are pleasant, but carry with them a worring dry astringency. Try drinking this over the near term, with rare beef to help ameliorate the tannin's effects.",Babich,New Zealand,87,70,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101043,Rentas de Fincas 2003 Crianza (Rioja),"A pretty decent Rioja for the vintage, but you're going to have to be ready for some rubbery aromas and then staunch red fruit with a little bite. It's quite the traditional wine, with lemon peel, leather and tobacco. Runs short on the finish.",Rentas de Fincas,Spain,85,15,Red Blend
101044,Setzer 2007 Vesper Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"The lightest in a range of Grüner Veltliner from Hans Setzer. This is a green apple and grapefruit flavored wine, all lightness, freshness and crispness. There is a green plum skin tang to it, added to citrus.",Setzer,Austria,85,20,Grüner Veltliner
101045,Tenuta Luisa 2007 Rive Alte Pinot Grigio (Isonzo del Friuli),"The wine boasts a pretty golden hue and segues to tones of almond skin, stone fruit, nut and cardboard. It feels smooth and rich in the mouth and has some tart citrus flavors on the close.",Tenuta Luisa,Italy,85,17,Pinot Grigio
101046,Honeywood Winery 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Far and away the freshest and most interesting of the three vintages submitted for review. The fruit retains more of its youthful gloss; it's riper and shows more cherry character, along with bright, spicy highlights. The tannins are proportionate and less earthy and herbal. This is no barn-burner, but it's a good quaffer.",Honeywood Winery,US,85,24,Pinot Noir
101047,I Clivi 2004 Bianco degli Arzillari White (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"There's a saccharin or soda-like element to the nose of this Verduzzo-Friulano blend that gives the wine a cheerful, upfront personality but that overpowers the natural fruit. The wine tastes both tart and sweet and ends with butterscotch candy flavors.",I Clivi,Italy,85,28,White Blend
101048,Irony 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This is a pretty good buy for a Merlot that shows lots of polish and sophistication. It has savory black cherry, currant, cola and spice flavors. The tannins are a little rugged and green, so it loses some points.",Irony,US,85,16,Merlot
101049,Kedar's K'orus NV Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de Pays d'Oc),"Created by music industry businessman Kedar Massenburg (CEO Motown Records), the K'orus range is produced in the Languedoc. This Cabernet Sauvignon gives blackberry fruits, very juicy, lightly sweet to finish, but retaining attractive structure and acidity.",Kedar's K'orus,France,85,12,Cabernet Sauvignon
101050,Kedar's K'orus NV Chardonnay (Vin de Pays d'Oc),"Easy, creamy wine, with soft apple flavors and a touch of citrus. There is a light edge of toast to round out the soft, fleshy aftertaste.",Kedar's K'orus,France,85,12,Chardonnay
101051,Little Black Dress 2006 Merlot (California),"Shows plenty of lush, ripe fruit, wrapped in soft tannins and balanced with crisp acids. The forward black cherry, red licorice, orange and smoky vanilla flavors are rich, and the price makes it a great value.",Little Black Dress,US,85,10,Merlot
101052,Marqués de Vizhoja 2007 Señor da Folla Verde White (Rías Baixas),"Quite leesy and funky, with meaty, oily aromas that are a departure from normal Albariño and are indicative of the 30% Treixadura and Loureiro that beef things up. Perfectly drinkable, and with a decent mouthfeel, but still it lacks the straightforward cleanliness of the really good wines from Galicia. Imported by Republic National Distributing Co.",Marqués de Vizhoja,Spain,85,25,White Blend
101053,Estancia 2007 Pinot Grigio (California),"Estancia produces solid, savory Pinot Grigios at a fair price, and they even dropped their price last year. This one's a little off-dry, with crisp acidity and pleasant citrus, peach and honeysuckle flavors.",Estancia,US,85,12,Pinot Grigio
101054,Finca La Emperatriz 2000 Reserva (Rioja),"With tobacco, molasses, spearmint and baked fruit aromas, this finds itself squarely in the old school forum. The palate shows straight-ahead red fruit with light herbal and pepper accents. Snappy and a bit thin, but it offers all the basics.",Finca La Emperatriz,Spain,85,30,Tempranillo Blend
101055,Vinai dell'Abbate 2006 Ribolla Gialla (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"Grassy and tonic with background shadings of white flower and stone fruit, this Ribolla Gialla offers aromas of white peach, kiwi and subtle hints of exotic fruit. The wine is crisp and lean in the mouth.",Vinai dell'Abbate,Italy,85,19,Ribolla Gialla
101056,Winzer Krems 2005 Sandgrube 13 Chremisa Zweigelt (Kremstal),"Beyond the spice of this cool-climate wine, the flavors offer red berry fruits, fresh acidity and stalky tannins. It's soft, easy to drink now.",Winzer Krems,Austria,85,24,Zweigelt
101057,Graf Hardegg 2007 Veltlinsky Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"One of the original in the new generation of light, fresh Grüner Veltliner, Veltlinsky is a good example. With its green apple directness and smooth structure, it is a wine for the year, a fine apéritif or seafood partner. Screwcap.",Graf Hardegg,Austria,85,10,Grüner Veltliner
101058,Botalcura 2006 El Delirio Reserve Syrah-Malbec Red (Central Valley),"A little tart and pickled off the bat, with notes of rhubarb and red cherry along with a stronger, more evident blast of oak. The palate is fresh but sort of lean and wanting, with regular raspberry and plum flavors. Snappy but slightly sappy and resiny for what's on offer.",Botalcura,Chile,85,11,Red Blend

101061,Château Bélingard 2005 Monbazillac,"As in nearby Sauternes, 2005 produced some exceptionally rich botrytised wine in Monbazillac.

101077,Alphonse Mellot 2014 En Grands Champs (Sancerre),"From old vines planted in a single vineyard, this is a spectacular red. It has the crisp acidity of the cool-climate Sancerre, but it also has the weight and ripeness of a fine Burgundy.

101101,Valdivieso 2008 Éclat Vigno Old Vine Blend Red (Maule Valley),"Despite showing gritty, scratchy aromas of baked, earthy black fruits, this Carignan-led blend is rock solid and ready.

101104,Mercer 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Yakima Valley),"With alcohol in the low-moderate range, this immaculately fresh wine is flush with juicy gooseberry and grapefruit.

101105,Michel Gassier 2012 Les Piliers Syrah (Costières de Nîmes),"This is as perfumed an example of Syrah as you'll find from the Southern Rhône.

101135,Château Vrai Caillou 2013 Bordeaux Supérieur,"This wine is structured and stalky without the fruit weight, reflecting the difficult vintage.

101138,Cantine Grasso 2014 Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane),"This easygoing, simple red offers hints of dark berry flavors while a note of dark spice fleetingly appears in the background. It's uber-informal and rather diluted with a short but clean finish.",Cantine Grasso,Italy,84,11,Nero d'Avola

101140,Madrigal 2012 Las Viñas del Señor Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),An uncomplicated combination of red and black berry bramble with an overlay of coconut shavings provides a ripeness of fruit atop sweetened tannins and dull oak in this wine.

101141,Millbrook 2013 Proprietor's Special Reserve Chardonnay (Hudson River Region),"Pronounced notes of butter, cheese and canned cream corn dominate this savory Chardonnay.

101142,Santa Rita 2014 Medalla Real Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Leyda Valley),"Aromas of corn and melon are waxy and oily. This feels pinched and juicy, but not crisp or minerally. Stalky flavors of corn, citrus and apple lean towards bitter, as does the finish.",Santa Rita,Chile,84,18,Chardonnay

101151,Concha y Toro 2014 Reserva Casillero del Diablo Carmenère (Central Valley),"Blocky, stewy, raisiny aromas of nonspecific black fruits are jumbled and green.

101152,Ports of New York NV Meleau White Specialty Wine White (New York),"Coffee grinds and caramel mingle with hints of popcorn and dried herbs in this curious blend of white grapes which have been aged Sherry-style in a solera.

101155,Fire Block 2004 Old Vine Shiraz (Clare Valley),"This wine boasts admirable complexity, but comes across as a bit angular, with the acids maybe a touch too prominent.

101162,Bisol NV Desiderio Jeio Brut (Prosecco del Veneto),"There's a distinctly mineral, almost ashen quality to this wine that recalls talcum powder and schoolroom chalkboard.

101171,Trapiche 2007 Broquel Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Apricot and oak aromas make for a smoky, slightly heavy bouquet. The wine keeps that weightiness as it passes from nectarine to citrus to tropical fruits. Long on the finish, with integrity.

101173,Pali 2006 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A little heavy and ripe for a Pinot Noir, this bottling shows pie-filling flavors of cherries, blackberries and currants, with a candied chocolate-covered mint sweetness. It also seems overly soft. Drink now.",Pali,US,86,48,Pinot Noir
101174,Robert Stemmler 2005 Nugent Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Stemmler's record is spotty with this bottling.

101244,Dr. Wehrheim 2007 Buntsandstein Weisser Burgunder Kabinett Trocken Pinot Blanc (Pfalz),"This medium-bodied dry white is prettily aromatic, showing hints of orange blossom, pineapple and pear upfront, then building on the base of fruit with hints of wet stones and a dry, almost chalky finish.",Dr. Wehrheim,Germany,88,20,Pinot Blanc

Tight and somewhat reductive when first opened, it slowly unwraps into a substantial effort, dense with berry, cherry and cassis concentrate.

101270,Lusco 2010 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Opens with peachy, citric and saline aromas. Feels moderately fresh, but seems as though it's starting to mature as it's fleshy and pithy.

101282,Bodegas Peñafiel 2006 Miros de Ribera Crianza (Ribera del Duero),"On the plus side, the wine is exotic and different, with blueberry, herbal notes, juniper and roasted aromas.

101324,Alta Alella 2013 Privat Gran Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava),"Briny cidery aromas are fortunately not that loud or intense.

101349,14 Hands 2010 Riesling (Washington),"Regrettably, this has no sweetness scale on the back label, but the 11.5% alcohol suggests that it is off-dry, as it certainly tastes. It's a heavy, honey-soaked style, perhaps due to grapes that were affected by botrytis. Apple juice and honey flavors are right in the heart of this wine, which would pair well with a simple dessert of fresh fruit.",14 Hands,US,86,10,Riesling
101350,Barraco 2010 Zibibbo (Sicilia),"Zibibbo is usually presented as a passito dessert wine, but this is dry. The natural floral fragrance of the variety emerges on the nose, while the mouthfeel and the honey and peach flavors are detailed with acids.",Barraco,Italy,86,35,Zibibbo

101352,Château Bois Noir 2009 Bordeaux Supérieur,"New wood dominates this soft wine.

101356,Flying Trout 2010 Cutthroat Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This mix of 62% Pepper Bridge Vineyard Syrah and 38% Klipsun Vineyard Malbec has not entirely come together.

101362,Stemmari 2011 Grillo (Sicilia),"Using fruit that was sourced from the vineyards of Feudo Arancio near the town of Sambuca in southern Sicily, this pretty white wine offers bright aromas of lemon, green apple and cut grass.

101363,Tablas Creek 2011 Côtes de Tablas Blanc White (Paso Robles),"A blend of Viognier, Grenache Blanc, Marasanne and Roussanne, this is very generous, offering orange, pear, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors.

101364,Torre Quarto 2009 Sangue Blu Negroamaro (Puglia),"“Sangue Blu,” which translates to “blue blood,” offers sun-drenched aromas of ripe fruit and rum cake that are backed by tobacco and sweet Indian spice notes. The mouthfeel is textured, gritty and rich.",Torre Quarto,Italy,86,18,Negroamaro
101365,Château de Ferrand 2008 Saint-Émilion,"Here's a solid, dark wine, with an old wood character. It has weight, a black plum flavor and dark tannins. This feels old and hard.",Château de Ferrand,France,86,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101366,Saint André de Figuière 2007 Magali Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"There's a slightly confected top-note of cotton candy or bubble gum to this wine, but also decent concentration of canteloupe and peach fruit aromas and flavors. It's plump and medium-bodied, with a touch of refreshing minerality on the finish.",Saint André de Figuière,France,87,15,Rosé
101367,Santa Alicia 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),Lavender and licorice on the nose; the palate mixes shy black cherry and cassis flavors with a bit of Chile's patented leafy character.

101371,Bonterra 2007 Rosé (Mendocino County),"Bonterra's first rosé, showing the clean purity and balance that nearly always characterize its wines. Bone dry and vibrant in acidity, this Sangiovese, Zinfandel and Grenache blend has tart cherry, raspberry, tea and vanilla flavors. You might want to open it early to let some sulfur blow off.",Bonterra,US,86,13,Rosé
101372,Chaddsford 2005 Syrah (Pennsylvania),"Intriguing all around, this displays earthy notes of truffle and meat on the nose, and balanced flavors of full raspberry and spicy caramel on the palate. Though a touch angular, the wine has elegance and good fruit.",Chaddsford,US,86,28,Syrah
101373,Di Lenardo 2007 Vigneto Vigne dai Vieris Pinot Bianco (Venezia Giulia),"This is a very fragrant and pungent Pinot Bianco with aromas of exotic fruit, pineapple, apricot and melon.

101377,Montevina 2005 Terra d'Oro Syrah (Amador County),"More tannic, drier and more acidic than most fine coastal Syrahs, this one from the Sierra Foothills is marked by its firm structure.The black currant, licorice, beef jerky and tobacco flavors are complex. Best now.",Montevina,US,86,18,Syrah
101378,Quinta de Ventozelo 2007 Cister da Ribeira White (Douro),"Ripe, fruity wine with quince and pineapple flavors, layered through with apple skin tannins.

101379,Substance 2006 Cs Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This austere and lightly herbal Cabernet is balanced and varietal, but at first seems a bit dull, as if tasted through a screen.

101383,TerraMater 2006 Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Curicó Valley),"A good but awkward attempt at a bigger, more saturated, more serious wine. The nose tells you that it's ripe, but there's some reduction in there too. The palate is revved up and tannic with turbulence along the way. Spice, chocolate and heat all play a part on the berry-driven palate.",TerraMater,Chile,86,20,Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère
101384,Fenestra 2006 Silvaspoons Vineyard Verdelho (Lodi),"Verdelho is one of those new varieties imported from old Europe that's providing a badly needed shot in the arm for California, namely, the need for crisply acidic, dry whites.

101387,Schmidt 2011 Malbec (Southern Oregon),"The high alcohol is a good indication of the ultraripe fruit flavors here.

101443,Judith Beck 2011 Pannobile Red (Burgenland),"Brooding flavors of dark cherry and pure cocoa initially play on the palate, but it slowly opens up to reveal a deceptive lightness.

Syrah and Alicante Bouschet bring southern richness to Touriga Franca and Touriga Nacional. Drink this wine now.",Mouchão,Portugal,93,20,Portuguese Red
101467,Pine Ridge 2013 Fortis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A top-of-the-line effort and a departure from the producer's single-vineyard, 100% varietal bottlings, this blends 4% Malbec and 3% Merlot. Spicy with clove scents, it showcases deep cassis and cranberry flavors, with a lift of red fruit and supportive acidity.",Pine Ridge,US,93,175,Cabernet Sauvignon
101468,Sandler 2015 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Plump but sour cranberry fruit aromas meet with sweet sandalwood, clove and forest floor on the nose of this San Francisco-made bottling from the historic property. Sanguine touches on the palate lead to raspberry, cherry, cinnamon and juniper flavors, ending in a menthol finish.",Sandler,US,93,36,Pinot Noir
101469,Sixteen by Twenty 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The partner label of Black Cordon, also made by consulting winemaker Paul Hobbs, this entry-level offering blends small amounts of all the red Bordeaux varieties and ages in 80% new French oak. Tar and graphite scents and bold, soft acidity support juicy black and red berry flavors, with a shock of anise. Best enjoyed 2023 through 2033.",Sixteen by Twenty,US,93,60,Cabernet Sauvignon
101470,Stone The Crows 2014 Three Twins Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"From an estate vineyard, this impressive wine is earthy with tobacco leaf and juicy cherry and cassis notes. Soft, supple and lengthy, it lingers on the palate as a well-integrated, balanced and beautifully crafted expression of the grape.",Stone The Crows,US,93,110,Cabernet Sauvignon
101471,Tolosa 2015 Hollister Edna Ranch Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Extremely luscious on the nose, this bottling is redolent of baked black cherries, vanilla, smoke and wet riverstones. That fruit-forward style carries over to the palate, with cherry pie and baking spice flavors, backed by a solid and an expertly balanced acidity that holds those rich flavors in check.",Tolosa,US,93,100,Pinot Noir
101472,Villa Poggio Salvi 2011 Riserva (Brunello di Montalcino),"Mature plum, ripe berry, baking spice, underbrush and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this full-bodied wine. On the chewy palate, notes of cinnamon, clove and licorice add depth to dried cherry and raspberry. Velvety tannins give it just enough tension and texture. Drink 2018–2024.",Villa Poggio Salvi,Italy,93,85,Sangiovese
101473,Volker Eisele Family Estate 2013 Sievers Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This varietal Cabernet Sauvignon hails from the producer's organic Chiles Valley estate. It's muscular and lushly layered, with spicy leather and tobacco notes accented by a delicate touch of violet and supported by firm, grippy tannin. Drink now through 2033.",Volker Eisele Family Estate,US,93,80,Cabernet Sauvignon
101474,TerraNoble 2006 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),"There's no shortage of heavily charred oak, and early on it may seem a bit mulchy and leathery. But as it knits together and the fruit rises, you'll see that there's a compact, serious wine laying in wait. Flavors of blackberry, licorice and herbs are authentic and powerful. Clacky tannins make food almost mandatory.",TerraNoble,Chile,86,12,Cabernet Sauvignon
101475,Terre de Trinci 2003 Riserva (Montefalco Rosso),"This blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Sagrantino is a simple, fruit-forward wine with loads of red cherry, blueberry, cedar wood and exotic spice. It has a gritty, spicy mouthfeel and big, powerful tannins.",Terre de Trinci,Italy,86,18,Red Blend
101476,Mosolo Gleni 2006 Pinot Grigio Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"Opens with a pretty shade of gold that denotes more sophisticated extraction and in fact that impression is carried through to the nose and mouth where the wine exhibits ripe fruity aromas, honey, almond skin, dried herbs and natural rubber. The mouthfeel is thin, but remains a step above the commercial Pinot Grigio that is so commonly available. The wine is packaged with a real vine clipping around the bottle neck.",Mosolo Gleni,Italy,86,15,Pinot Grigio
101477,Arbor Crest 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This has light but sweet fruit flavor, leaning heavily toward strawberry and Bing cherry candy. The fruit is a bit mismatched to the tannins, which are thick and chewy, but with additional bottle age the middle may fill out somewhat. It's got a pretty, fruity entry and a substantial, slightly earthy finish; it's just that midpalate that falls a bit short.",Arbor Crest,US,86,20,Cabernet Sauvignon
101478,Aresti 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rio Claro),"A solid wine with a good mix of herbal, cola and red-fruit aromas. It deals spanking red fruit flavors and a sprinkle of vanilla and chocolate on the racy finish. For a short, fresh and clean wine, Aresti's Cab makes the grade.",Aresti,Chile,86,14,Cabernet Sauvignon
101479,Wolf Blass 2005 Yellow Label Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia),"This 60-40 blend features gentle aromas of vanilla and cassis in a medium-bodied, creamy-smooth format. It's not powerful or complex, but offers pure cassis and vanilla flavors tinged with chocolate on the finish. Good value.",Wolf Blass,Australia,85,12,Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon
101480,Chilensis 2006 Reserva Syrah (Maule Valley),"Big, bold, wild and dark, with mild burnt aromas backed by broad blackberry and plum flavors. This represents the fruity, thick style of Syrah, with additional notes of black olive and savory meat pie. It's not flawless but its pounding fruit character will earn its share of fans.",Chilensis,Chile,85,9,Syrah
101481,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2007 Los Vascos Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"Pungent and sharp, and that's exactly the style that Los Vascos has mastered in recent years. This wine tastes very much like a coastal, Casablanca Chardonnay yet it hails from Colchagua. The nose is pithy and citric, and the palate is more of the same. Good mouthfeel and fresh, but green, citrusy and too much like Sauvignon Blanc.",Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite),Chile,85,12,Chardonnay
101482,Fetzer 2006 Valley Oaks Riesling (California),"With quite a bit of residual sugar, this Riesling is sweet, but balanced with crisp acidity that makes it clean and zesty. The flavors are of peaches, apricots, candied ginger, honeysuckle and vanilla. Low alcohol makes it easy to drink.",Fetzer,US,85,9,Riesling
101483,Finca Sophenia 2006 Altosur Cabernet Sauvignon (Tupungato),"Rather sweet and medicinal; the wine comes into form on the palate, which is fairly bright and forward as it pushes raspberry and cherry flavors. Acidity is on the high side, so the feel and finish have some burn. Could use some pizza or meat to help it along.",Finca Sophenia,Argentina,85,10,Cabernet Sauvignon
101484,Fournier Père et Fils 2006 Fournier (Menetou-Salon),"A light wine, somewhat unfocused and lacking fruit intensity. But it is certainly pleasant, clean and fresh, with a definite green tinge and a citrus aftertaste.",Fournier Père et Fils,France,85,19,Sauvignon Blanc
101485,Barker's Marque 2007 Arona Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Shows plenty of weight on the palate, but also an overall lack of intensity to its slightly vegetal—green pea—flavors. Still, there's enough passion fruit and grapefruit to provide a sense of balance and a crisp, clean finish.",Barker's Marque,New Zealand,85,11,Sauvignon Blanc
101486,Beringer 2004 Bancroft Ranch Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"The vineyard is on Howell Mountain. It's an awkward wine, with lots to like, but some problems. On the plus side is enormous cassis, cherry and chocolate fruit flavor and rich, fine tannins, and the 100% new oak seems proper given the wine's volume. But there's too much sugary sweetness in the finish, almost like a dessert wine.",Beringer,US,85,75,Merlot
101487,Bock 2000 Cuvée Barrique Red (Villány),"The rich, spicy and savory nose evoke the food for which the country is known, and this wine would undoubtedly pair well with full-bodied, spiced meats and stews. Its full, spicy nose leads into dependable flavors of red berry, wooded spice and pepper, with a slightly bitter, smoked edge. Not a terribly complex wine, but solid and tasty nonetheless.",Bock,Hungary,85,48,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101488,Carneros Creek 2006 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Shows a beautiful Pinotesque mouthfeel, all silk and satin, with that elegant Carneros acidity. But the flavors could be more concentrated. The cherries, cola and pomegranates feel a little watered down.",Carneros Creek,US,85,22,Pinot Noir
101489,Casale Triocco 2003 Sagrantino di Montefalco,"This is a bold and powerful wine with distinctive green notes that recall dried grass, black pepper and spice. It also has bitter chocolate, cardamom and cumin and its tannins are so strong, they literally leave your palate parched and dry.",Casale Triocco,Italy,85,35,Sagrantino
101490,Castello di Monastero 2004 Sangiovese (Toscana),"Here's a delicate, feminine Sangiovese with a thin consistency and mature aromas of forest berry, raspberry, black olive and spice. It's a bit thorny in places with sour notes on the finish but it would pair well with pasta or pizza.",Castello di Monastero,Italy,85,12,Sangiovese
101491,Konrad 2006 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),"Offers herb, cranberry and cherry aromas upfront, followed by a medium-bodied palate that's cedary and herbal, but also shows some chunky cherry fruit. Finishes on oaky notes of coffee and chocolate.",Konrad,New Zealand,85,23,Pinot Noir
101492,Lungarotti 2006 Pinot Grigio Pinot Grigio (Umbria),"Here's a lean, almost colorless, citrus-driven Grigio from sunny Umbria that has a bit of candy and cola on its sweet, fragrant nose. There are peppermint renderings and dried hay in the background. It's watery and lean in the mouth and would pair with appetizers or simple vegetable dishes.",Lungarotti,Italy,85,15,Pinot Grigio
101493,Mana 2006 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),"A soft, easy-to-drink Pinot Noir—even for Marlborough. Tannins are developed and supple, while the flavors lean toward caramel, cherry and sandalwood. Drink now.",Mana,New Zealand,85,16,Pinot Noir
101494,Michel Torino 2007 Coleccion Chardonnay (Calchaquí Valley),"Light, floral and somewhat out of the mold. Flavors of apricot, peach and mango are both fresh and fleshy, while the finish lingers for quite some time. Fairly forceful but restrained enough.",Michel Torino,Argentina,85,12,Chardonnay
101495,Robert Hall 2005 Vintage Port Port (Paso Robles),"Made from authentic Port varieties, this dessert wine is quite sweet. The residual sugar is about 9.5%, giving a honeyed finish to the blackberry and chocolate flavors. It doesn't have the complexity for aging, so drink now.",Robert Hall,US,85,34,Port
101496,Rubissow 2004 Trompettes Red (Mount Veeder),"A blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with a splash of Cabernet Sauvignon, this tannic, dry wine has flavors of cherries, vanilla and smoky oak. It may develop some additional complexities over time.",Rubissow,US,85,65,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101497,Santa Julia 2007 Organica Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Round, nutty and smooth, with melon, citrus and apple flavors. In this wine's case, organic does not equal complexity. That said, what's here is clean and balanced, and there's more than enough fruit and intensity to satisfy.",Santa Julia,Argentina,85,10,Chardonnay
101498,Santa Julia 2007 Pinot Grigio (Mendoza),"Timing is everything with this full-bodied PG. Get at it right away and it will still be almost viscous, but it should also show ripe tropical fruit flavors, core acidity and lots of personality. Just don't let it hang around for long, especially not at room temperature.",Santa Julia,Argentina,85,8,Pinot Grigio
101499,Ronco Blanchis 2006 Pinot Grigio (Collio),"This Pinot Grigio is a bit more fragrant and floral in essence with aromas of stone fruit and peach blossom. It has a fresh, almost piquant edge but it also has that characteristic watery mouthfeel you'll likely encounter with this variety.",Ronco Blanchis,Italy,85,16,Pinot Grigio
101500,San Pedro 2006 Castillo de Molina Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Cachapoal Valley),"The oak on this wine gives it a strong resin and cinnamon character. Along the way there's floral berry aromas, cherry and plum flavors, and finishing notes of root beer, chocolate and cough drops. A bit woody and tannic but it gets the job done.",San Pedro,Chile,85,12,Cabernet Sauvignon
101501,Planeta 2011 Cometa Fiano (Sicilia),"Among the greatest expressions of Fiano, Cometa is a full and generous effort, with deep layers of passion fruit and stone fruit, plus touches of vanilla, honey and light spice. The concentration and freshness is wonderful, and the wine would pair well with steamed lobsters or buttery crab legs.",Planeta,Italy,92,43,Fiano
101502,Sequana 2010 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Lush and opulent, this shows complex flavors of cherry compote, raspberry jam, date and exotic spice. Thoroughly dry on the finish, this drinks well right now. It offers a delicacy that's sometimes missing in Santa Lucia Pinot Noirs. From Hess Collection.",Sequana,US,92,32,Pinot Noir
101503,Small Vines 2010 Baranoff Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Really easy to like now for its silky approachability, and for the way the flavors gather upfront and through the long, spicy finish.

The fruit is sourced from the cool, southern part of the Russian River Valley.",Small Vines,US,92,71,Pinot Noir
101504,Tasca d'Almerita 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sicilia),"Despite the problematic vintage, this wine opens with bold aromatic intensity, featuring notes of prune, plum, blackberry and spice. On the palate, the wine is structured and firm, with a touch of sweet cherry on the finish.",Tasca d'Almerita,Italy,92,65,Cabernet Sauvignon

101506,Bründlmayer 2011 Steinmassel Erste Lage Riesling (Kamptal),"Made using fruit from one of the top Kamptal vineyards, this perfumed wine has great texture, with tight acidity and notes of green plum skin and lemon zest. With its depth of flavor and nervy, minerally edge, it will age for at least four years.",Bründlmayer,Austria,92,,Riesling
101507,Château d'Aydie 2010 Madiran Laplace Tannat (Madiran),"A rich, full-bodied wine from one of the masters of Tannat, Pierre Laplace, this has ripe tannins and layers of toast, black plum and berry, with intense acidity on the finish.",Château d'Aydie,France,92,15,Tannat
101508,Château de Gaudou 2009 Réserve Caillou Malbec (Cahors),"Made using fruit sourced from a parcel of vines more than 60 years old, this is a dense, dark wine, with herb, dark fig and plum notes.

101509,Château des Jacques 2011 Clos de Rochegrès (Moulin-à-Vent),"This is rich, spicy and full of red cherry flavor. It also has a dark, firm structure from the granite-based soil. The acidity that cuts through the fruit lends balance. Age this for 2–3 years.",Château des Jacques,France,92,,Gamay
101510,Emiliana 2009 Gê Red (Colchagua Valley),"Gê is one of Chile's perennial best blends. It mixes Syrah, Carmenère and Cabernet Sauvignon into a lovable, complex whole.

101516,Charles Krug 2009 Vintage Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Vintage Selection has long been the winery's age-worthy 100% Cabernet. Although this has an alcohol content that's higher than in the past, it should still reward cellaring. The wine is rich with a sweet blackberry flavor, with lots of new French oak. The tannins are hard, reminiscent of an older era of Napa Cabernet. Give it 5–6 years, but anything longer than that and the fruit may be threatened.",Charles Krug,US,92,75,Cabernet Sauvignon
101517,Château Blaignan 2010 Médoc,"Aromatic hints of new wood translate onto the smooth palate. It has smoke and black currant flavors, with tannins that are already well integrated.

101519,Château de Gaudou 2010 Renaissance Malbec (Cahors),"A powerful, wood-aged wine, this shows weighty black fruit and a toasty character.

101520,Concha y Toro 2009 Terrunyo Vineyard Selection Block Las Terrazas Unfiltered Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"The nose is an attractive mix of cassis and mineral notes. The palate is more racy and wiry than dense and soft, with juicy, flashy flavors of berry, cherry and currant.

101531,Jean León 2015 3055 Chardonnay (Penedès),"This wine's melon and mango aromas come with an oily note of lanolin. It feels lazy on the palate, with just enough acidity to maintain freshness.

101550,Valdivieso 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"Briny saltwater aromas dominate a mild mostly fruitless nose. This feels basic and round, with a lemony streak. Mild nectarine flavors don't amount to much, while this is simple and generic on the finish.",Valdivieso,Chile,85,10,Sauvignon Blanc
101551,Villa Cordevigo 2016 Heaven Scent (Bardolino Chiaretto),"Subtly scented, this opens with aromas of citrus zest, spring flower and wild berry. It's fresh and informal, with light strawberry and sour-cherry flavors supported by fresh acidity.",Villa Cordevigo,Italy,85,20,Rosato

Vanilla, espresso, fine tannins, luscious acids and cascading fruits.",Quilceda Creek,US,99,125,Cabernet Sauvignon
101558,Williams Selyem 2009 Precious Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A stupendous Pinot Noir, showing how beautifully this vineyard performs in the remote Sonoma Coast above Fort Ross. Williams Selyem's last few vintages of Precious Mountain have been extraordinary, but this 2009 tops them all. The wine is as light as a feather in the mouth, modest in alcohol and delicately feminine, like pure satin. However, few Pinot Noirs in the world achieve this level of concentration. Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious. After all that, it possesses an indefinable attribute of fascination. Will age well for a long time, if you can keep your hands off it. Now–2021.",Williams Selyem,US,99,94,Pinot Noir
101559,Château Margaux 2009 Margaux,"A massive wine for Margaux, packed with tannins and ripe fruit.

The wine is structured, a powerhouse of concentration while preserving this complete style.",Château Palmer,France,98,380,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101561,Pirouette 2008 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A stunning Pirouette—63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot, 9% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Full and magnificently rich, it is loaded with dense and thrilling fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis. A streak of iron and a hint of citrus keep the wine evolving through a long, beautifully balanced finish. Retasted after being open for 24 hours, the wine was as fresh and thrilling as on the first day.",Pirouette,US,98,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend

101566,JCB 2009 No. 1 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"An outstanding wine, the best California Cabernet Jean-Charles Boisset has ever produced from any of his properties. It stands out in any tasting of its peers. Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and aged in 60% new oak, it shows satisfying, complex flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cassis, hazelnut-infused chocolate and spices. Hard to exaggerate its power and grace. Wonderful now and for a good six years, but it's difficult to predict its evolution beyond 2018.",JCB,US,97,150,Cabernet Sauvignon
101567,Château La Mission Haut-Brion 2009 Pessac-Léognan,"Such a generous and ripe wine, with a dark core of tannins surrounded by opulent fruit.

101573,Château la Fleur-Pétrus 2009 Pomerol,"Just across the road from Pétrus, la Fleur-Pétrus shares some of the same intensity.

101575,Groth 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"A huge Cabernet, in the best sense of the word. It wasn't the easiest vintage, as 2007 was, but meticulous winemaking did the job, resulting in this amazingly rich, impressively ripe wine that's drinkable now and will develop for many years. The fruits veer toward blackberries, cherries and cola, and the tannins are soft and refined. One hundred percent new French oak isn't at all heavy, lending nuances of buttered toast and sweet wood tannins. Will easily age for 15 years.",Groth,US,96,125,Cabernet Sauvignon
101576,Château Mouton Rothschild 2009 Pauillac,"The purest Cabernet Sauvignon fruit, with dark chocolate and intense dark berry flavors. The tannins are so enveloped by the fruit and yet they promise great aging. At this stage, wood shows through the fruit, but the texture is so rich and opulent that it should easily become integrated.",Château Mouton Rothschild,France,96,1300,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101577,Château Trotanoy 2009 Pomerol,"Beneath the surface tannins is great Merlot fruit, very ripe and full-bodied, a powerhouse of flavors.

101578,Williams Selyem 2009 Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A triumph, one of the greatest Riverblock bottings in years. This always is a captivating wine, but the '09 is particularly scrumptious. Although it's quite tannic and acidic, it's forward enough in raspberries, cherries and cola to enjoy now. But it's bone dry and as elegant as California Pinot Noir gets. The balance suggests an ability to age for a good 10 years, if not longer.",Williams Selyem,US,96,78,Pinot Noir
101579,Château Beau-Séjour Bécot 2009 Saint-Émilion,"Minty new wood aromas on a wine that shows both great tannins and sweet wood.

101580,Williams Selyem 2009 Flax Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A sip is all it takes to fall in love with this potent Pinot Noir.

101583,Château Canon la Gaffelière 2009 Saint-Émilion,"One of the peculiarities of St.-Émilion's classification is that Canon la Gaffelière is not classed in the top rung. Because, as this wine shows, it produces superb wines. This is ripe while so elegant, with great intensity and sweet perfumes.",Château Canon la Gaffelière,France,95,110,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101584,Doyenne 2008 Grand Ciel Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain),"Certainly the finest Grand Ciel Syrah to date, this is a full-flavored, complete wine, loaded with pure fruit flavors of berry and cassis. The details pile on—a whiff of stone, a hint of chocolate, suggestions of spice, all in perfect proportion.",Doyenne,US,95,60,Syrah
101585,Hanzell 2009 Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"A tremendous Chardonnay. As always, the winery's '09 is bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally. You might call it austere at this point, with its tart finish of grapefruit. But a great Hanzell Chardonnay will improve for at least a decade, possible two, and this is a great Hanzell Chardonnay. The score reflects what the wine likely will be approximately eight years down the road.",Hanzell,US,95,75,Chardonnay
101586,Balletto 2013 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A blend of three vineyards, all estate, this is a sublime, viscous and somewhat briny wine that exhibits some oak on the nose. With a balance of weight and creaminess, it starts in ginger and nutmeg spiciness on the nose, building on the palate into fresh-cut apple and pear.",Balletto,US,88,28,Chardonnay
101587,Billsboro 2013 Sawmill Creek Vineyards Syrah (Finger Lakes),"Ripe, luscious black cherries and berries are framed by whispers of bramble and tannin in this enticingly fruity, forward Syrah.

101588,C'est Bon 2013 Reserve Selection Chardonnay (Oakville),"Waxy apple and lemon pith open this wine, followed by crisp, candied grapefruit. Robust, it finishes dry and balanced. The whole sums up into a full-bodied, rich and lush experience.",C'est Bon,US,88,35,Chardonnay
101589,Ceuso 2014 Scurati Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane),"Aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, dark spice and game come together in the glass.

101590,Château Balac 2012 Cru Bourgeois (Haut-Médoc),"This wine enjoys the fruitiness of the vintage with its black-currant flavors and light tannic structure.

101591,Château des Annereaux 2011 Lalande de Pomerol,"Now managed organically, this estate has produced a light, fruity wine.

101592,Château Frank NV Célèbre Crémant Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Gorgeous floral tones abound throughout this fruity, fresh, sparkling Riesling.

101593,Château Haut-Bergey 2013 Pessac-Léognan,"This fresh wine has attractive citrus and yellow fruit flavors and an orange tang. It needs more time; drink from 2017.

101594,Château Larrivet Haut-Brion 2014 Les Hauts de Larrivet Haut-Brion (Pessac-Léognan),"Herbal and fruity at this young stage, this wine is bright with acidity, citrus fruits and a tangy texture. It is still young and almost too crisp for its own good, although it will likely develop into an attractively fruity, ripe wine with a fine weight of flavor. Drink from 2017.",Château Larrivet Haut-Brion,France,88,30,Sauvignon Blanc
101595,Château le Sartre 2013 Pessac-Léognan,"Bright and fruity, this is classic white Bordeaux with its citrus and lively acidity as well as a crisp texture. It has weight and shows some potential to fill out, so drink from 2017.

101596,Château Mancèdre 2013 Pessac-Léognan,This wine is dry but rich enough with black-currant flavors to compensate. The juicy aftertaste suggests the wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2017. This wine is the latest result of renovations on the 15-generation and 400-year-old Trocard family estate.,Château Mancèdre,France,88,45,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101597,Château Peyredon Lagravette 2013 Haut-Médoc,"This small 10-acre property has produced an attractively fruity wine with soft tannins and juicy black-fruit flavors. It is lightly structured—displaying more fruit than tannin—and has a fresh, bright aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",Château Peyredon Lagravette,France,88,22,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101598,Château Potensac 2013 Chapelle de Potensac (Médoc),"This second wine of Château Potensac is soft, fruity with a hint of firmer structure. Juicy Cabernet gives the wine its shape and freshness. It is already drinkable, fruity and fresh.",Château Potensac,France,88,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101599,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2012 Indian Wells Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is equal parts Syrah and Merlot (43% each), with the balance a smattering of other varieties.

101602,Domaine Anderson 2013 Walraven Vineyard Chardonnay (Anderson Valley),"Pure butterscotch aromas seem to leap from the glass, yet the flavors are dry and rather reserved, not nearly as obvious as the smell. The balance leans toward tartness, the flavors are lean and the finish lemony.",Domaine Anderson,US,88,55,Chardonnay

101604,Feudo Antico 2010 Memorie Rosato (Sicilia),"Made with Nero d'Avola and aged in wood, this unusual rosato opens with aromas that recall mature red fruit, cake spice, chopped sage, oak and a balsamic note. The smooth, round palate offers candied red cherry, tangerine zest, toasted almond and a note of candied ginger alongside bright acidity. It has a tutti frutti finish but the overall array of flavors gives it some depth.",Feudo Antico,Italy,88,25,Rosato
101605,Gamache 2012 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Vanilla, licorice, herb and woodspice aromas are followed by slightly gritty-feeling cranberry flavors. This wine is interesting, but it doesn't all come together.",Gamache,US,88,25,Cabernet Franc
101606,Mills Reef 2014 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Hawke's Bay),"This medium-bodied wine is marked by dry, stony notes rather than a profusion of fruit. Subtle leafiness and hints of underripe melon give this a restrained aspect and suggest it's more of a food partner than a wine that will shine on its own.",Mills Reef,New Zealand,87,18,Sauvignon Blanc

101609,Browne Family Vineyards 2014 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Vanilla, coconut and toast aromas are vibrant and out-front, followed by tropical fruit.

101610,Caruso & Minini 2012 Cutaja Riserva Nero d'Avola (Delia Nivolelli),"Mature plum, aromatic herb and a whiff of cocoa lead the nose.

101612,Château Amour 2013 Médoc,"Under the same ownership as Château de Panigon, this property (which has a heart on its cork) has produced a wine offering layers of smoky wood as well as ripe fruit.

101616,Gabriel Meffre 2015 La Châsse Sauvignon-Colombard White (Vin de France),"This typical blend from southwest France draws on the intensely herbal character of both grapes. It's crisp, perfumed and refreshingly fruity, making it a great apéritif.",Gabriel Meffre,France,85,10,White Blend

101623,Aymara 2015 Estate Torrontés (Maipú),"Flat aromas of lanolin and oily white fruits lead to a round, full palate that's getting tired. Salty nectarine and flowery flavors finish with a yeasty note of ham and white fruits.",Aymara,Argentina,85,13,Torrontés

101628,Gruet NV Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (America),Intense yeasty aromas lean a bit nutty with a suggestion of citrus.

101629,Jean-Max Roger 2015 Le Charnay (Menetou-Salon),"This is an easy, open wine that is lightly herbal. There is a barnyard edge that masks the fruit, although there is bright crisp acidity to give it a lift. Drink now.",Jean-Max Roger,France,85,22,Sauvignon Blanc
101630,Magnum Vinhos 2015 Flor de Maio Mayflower Red (Alentejano),"Named after the poppy that blooms in May in the Alentejo, this wine is juicy and fruity, with a light touch of tannins.

101632,Blue Valley 2015 Muskat Ottonel (Middleburg),"Powerful aromas of lychee, mango and peach give a vibrant feel tropical to this wine.

101633,Vinadeis 2016 Le Val Merlot (Vin de France),"The sunshine of the Languedoc comes through in this wine's warm, soft fruit. A touch of acidity and a backdrop of tannins give it contrast and a fine, ready-to-drink character.",Vinadeis,France,85,12,Merlot
101634,Wines & Winemakers 2014 Dona Helena Reserva Red (Península de Setúbal),"Structured and with solid tannins, this is a wood- and spice-laden wine. Its fruit lies somewhere behind all this structure and is likely to remain there.",Wines & Winemakers,Portugal,85,15,Portuguese Red
101635,Zolo 2017 Sustainably Farmed Estate Grown and Bottled Rosé (Mendoza),"This youthful pink-colored number smells of dusty cherry and Lifesavers. A juicy palate has a soda-like feel, while flavors of raspberry and cherry are light and dilute across the finish.",Zolo,Argentina,85,10,Rosé
101636,Gnarly Head 2015 Pinot Noir (California),A bit of charred wood and black pepper in the aroma give way to lush berry and cherry flavors that spread across the palate and cling to the sides of the mouth. This wine is lightly oaky and has an attractive richness that lasts on the finish.,Gnarly Head,US,85,12,Pinot Noir
101637,Jacob's Creek 2016 Chardonnay (Australia),"Tightly constructed for an entry-priced Chardonnay, this has faint almond nuttiness accenting pineapple and grapefruit flavors. Drink this medium-bodied wine through mid-2018.",Jacob's Creek,Australia,85,8,Chardonnay

101639,Domaine de Reuilly 2015 Pinot Noir (Reuilly),This is a crisp cherry-flavored wine. Cool-climate Pinot Noir has a light texture that gives the wine a hint of tannins although it is much more about fruit and bright acidity. Drink now.,Domaine de Reuilly,France,85,20,Pinot Noir

101641,Fiuza 2015 Tinta Miúda Red (Tejo),"Tinta Miúda, known as the rare Graciano grape in Spain, is not often found in Portugal. Here it makes a ripe, juicy and jammy wine that's soft, with only a minimum of tannins to keep it together. It has a typically warm character and is ready to drink.",Fiuza,Portugal,85,12,Portuguese Red
101642,Tie-Dye 2014 Red (North Coast),Substantial fruit flavors and a lightly sweet balance give this medium- bodied wine a decent drinkability factor. The mouthfeel is slightly tannic and the finish is brief.,Tie-Dye,US,85,15,Red Blend

101646,Portal del Montsant 2014 Bruberry Red (Montsant),"Cherry cough drop and minerally, almost chlorine aromas lead to an edgy high-acid hard palate.

101647,Benvenuto de la Serna 2015 Mil Piedras Viognier (Vista Flores),"Lime and tangerine aromas are light and dusty, with a yeasty note.

101648,Decoy 2013 Red (Sonoma County),"This plummy, dusty red wine is simple and straightforward in its approach to tannin and oak. Offered at a fair price it should please a wide range of palates.",Decoy,US,85,25,Red Blend

101653,Oak Knoll 2014 Cloud Rest Vineyard Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"This is a neutral, papery white wine, with a flat, rather than lively mouthfeel. The apple flavored fruit is there, along with a touch of licorice, but the freshness seems to have been lost along the way.",Oak Knoll,US,85,18,Pinot Gris
101654,Parras Wines 2015 Mula Velha Reserva Red (Lisboa),"Mula Velha, “the old donkey,” is a younger wine than its name suggests.

101655,Parras Wines 2015 Terra Grande Red (Alentejano),"This wine is ripe, full of black fruits and soft tannins. With plenty of acidity to keep it crisp, the wine has a cool, flavorful character topped off by berry fruits. It's ready to drink.",Parras Wines,Portugal,85,10,Portuguese Red

101658,Château Troupian 2014 Haut-Médoc,"High-toast aromas are followed on the palate by flavors that are more about wood than fruit. That gives the wine a tough, extracted character that probably will not go away.",Château Troupian,France,85,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101659,Château Vrai Caillou 2015 Entre-Deux-Mers,"This is a crisp and fruity wine that's perfumed and full of citrus and green fruits.

101660,Cliff Creek 2011 Sams Valley Vineyard Claret (Southern Oregon),"Roughly equal portions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot go into this tannic blend. It may be a little too far along the aging curve, at least for showing much fruit. It's drying out—displaying a touch of leather—and should be consumed as soon as possible.",Cliff Creek,US,85,25,Claret
101661,Del Rio 2013 Claret (Rogue Valley),"The Claret benefits from an additional year of bottle age, integrating the components (60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% each Cab Franc and Malbec).

101662,Delfino 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Umpqua Valley),"This is a light simple red, without particular varietal character. It's much like an inexpensive California Merlot—fine for every day drinking, generic and unassuming.",Delfino,US,85,28,Cabernet Sauvignon
101663,Gru 2015 Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,"This inky-colored zesty wine offers aromas of sour cherry, leather and a hint of dried herb. The extremely simple, easygoing palate shows red plum and a hint of clove alongside loose knit tannins.",Gru,Italy,85,10,Montepulciano
101664,J. Portugal Ramos 2015 Pouca Roupa Branco White (Alentejano),"This wine is smooth and soft, with an attractive creamy texture and light acidity.

Portugal Ramos,Portugal,85,13,Portuguese White
101665,First & Local 2015 Chardonnay (California),"Light cinnamon and sugar aromas, and fresh, fruity and lightly sweet flavors make this wine easy on the palate. The texture is soft.",First & Local,US,85,10,Chardonnay
101666,Amalaya 2015 Esperanza Por Un Milagro White (Salta),Oily aromas of citrus peel and lychee set up a lemony palate with pyrazine-influenced citrus flavors. Lychee is the lead flavor on a finish that's mildly bitter.,Amalaya,Argentina,85,12,White Blend
101667,Half Mile Creek 2014 Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (South Eastern Australia),"Wet stone and graphite scents up front give way to hints of honey and Earl Grey tea (bergamot). It's medium bodied and fades quickly on the finish, but it's a solid buy for under $10.",Half Mile Creek,Australia,85,9,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc
101668,California Republic 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"This good, basic wine offers herb and cherry aromas, mostly crisp fruit flavors and a firm, tannic texture.",California Republic,US,85,12,Cabernet Sauvignon
101669,Cantina Valle Tritana 2014 Capostrano (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),"Aromas of dark-skinned berry, plum and blue flower come together on this.

101670,Château Doms 2014 Graves,This is a light and fruity wine that is ready to drink. It has spice and a layer of dry tannins that are acting as a support to the red fruits and acidity.,Château Doms,France,85,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101671,Château Pindefleurs 2013 Saint-Émilion,This is a seriously wood-aged wine. Its burnt toast character doesn't chime with the light fruitiness of the vintage and so gives a wine that is bitter and extracted. Less overworking would have produced a better wine.,Château Pindefleurs,France,85,28,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101672,Cliff Creek 2012 Sams Valley Vineyard Merlot (Southern Oregon),"This wine seems overtaken with scents and flavors of tree tar and resin. The impression of pine resin cuts out the fruit, leaving some woody flavors in the finish.",Cliff Creek,US,85,25,Merlot
101673,Quady North 2007 Flagship Syrah (Applegate Valley),"Quady North's Flagship is what the owners consider the best lot of wine of the year. Generously slathered in toasty new oak, this very limited (two barrel) reserve from the estate's Frank's Vineyard is not the blockbuster of the previous vintage, but shows exceptional winemaking skills. Black cherry fruit is wrapped in woody tannins, a yin-yang combination that works by dissonance rather than harmony.",Quady North,US,90,65,Syrah
101674,Qupé 2010 Marsanne (Santa Ynez Valley),"A huge, ripe, opulent wine, rich in orange, butter, peach, honey and spice flavors. Shows great depth and power, yet finishes thoroughly dry and crisp.

101675,Réserve des Oliviers 2009 White (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"Not a big, overwhelming blockbuster, this harmonious blend of equal parts Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Clairette and Bourboulenc features ripe citrus and pineapple flavors, with a hint of melon thrown in for good measure. It's pleasantly medium bodied and creamy in the mouth, with a reasonably long finish. Drink it over the next 12–18 months.",Réserve des Oliviers,France,90,40,Rhône-style White Blend
101676,Tardieu-Laurent 2007 Hermitage,"Like many of the '07 Hermitages, this isn't a huge wine, but instead shows a nice sense of proportion, marrying hickory smoke with touches of cracked peppercorns, cedar and roasted beef. Drink now–2020.",Tardieu-Laurent,France,90,126,Syrah
101677,Sant Agnese dei F.lli Gigli 2006 Libatio Red (Toscana),"Libatio shows nice integration with smooth tones of cassis, blueberry, white almond and dried spice. The results deliver balance and elegance and make this a food-friendly option for meat or hearty pasta dishes.",Sant Agnese dei F.lli Gigli,Italy,90,,Red Blend
101678,Bonaccorsi 2008 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Flamboyantly rich in cherries, raspberries and cranberries that are a bit tart, yet enriched with sweet oak.

101679,Chanin 2008 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Gavin Chanin makes this distinctive, interesting Chardonnay.

101680,Cuda Ridge Wines 2008 Cabernet Franc (Livermore Valley),"Another Livermore Valley producer to watch, Cuda Ridge has fashioned a varietally textbook Cab Franc here, with an intensely woody, herbal nose. Medium-bodied, with tannins that are integrated and ready to soften, this Cab Franc, barrel-aged for 18 months, is really, really good, and ready to age another 3–5 years.",Cuda Ridge Wines,US,90,28,Cabernet Franc
101681,Doña Silvina 2006 Malbec (Mendoza),"Opens with rooty, baked aromas before finding its legs and plenty of ripe, attractive berry fruit. The palate is juicy and solid, with good acidity and nice flavors of wild berry, chocolate and toast. Stylish and very solid. Definitely a food-friendly Malbec.",Doña Silvina,Argentina,90,25,Malbec
101682,Dürnberg 2007 Impetus Select Red (Niederösterreich),"Bordeaux grapes mix with Zweigelt in this full-bodied, serious wine. It has initial severe tannins, followed by ripe currant and blackberry fruit. The wood aging gives good spice character. Well worth aging for 3–4 years.",Dürnberg,Austria,90,20,Austrian Red Blend
101683,Il Veltro 2005 Brunello di Montalcino,"Il Veltro is a newish brand of Brunello from Montalcino that opens with bright berry nuances and background notes of spice, cola, tobacco and leather. The mouthfeel is rich and firm, enduring but not too heavy or overdone.",Il Veltro,Italy,90,,Sangiovese Grosso
101684,Lange 2010 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Fruit-driven, with pear and apple, but an interesting streak of licorice running down the spine of the wine. It has depth and good structure, so the now-dominant young fruit will have support as it ages. Worth sitting on for a couple more years.",Lange,US,90,16,Pinot Gris
101685,Markus Huber 2010 Grüner Veltliner (Traisental),"Complex, mineral wine, crisp but also very, very textured. Flavors of peach and red apples work with pink grapefruit to give the fruit character, while there is also a more serious complexity of green herbs. The finish is soft, still mineral. Screwcap.",Markus Huber,Austria,90,16,Grüner Veltliner
101686,Massi di Mandorlaia 2007 Colpetroso (Maremma),"Rosemary-marinated steak, roast pork roll stuffed with prunes or dark chicken or turkey meat would make perfect paring partners to this red blend from southern Tuscany. Aromas of spice, mature cherry and leather are soft and penetrating.",Massi di Mandorlaia,Italy,90,,Red Blend
101687,Melrose 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Umpqua Valley),"Fragrant with a mix of sweet grass and dusty blossom, this pleasant Sauvignon Blanc makes you wonder why the grape is so rare in Oregon. Here in the Umpqua Valley it finds a sweet spot, fresh and varietal, round and tart, with the added complexity of the flowery aromatics.",Melrose,US,90,18,Sauvignon Blanc
101688,Pieve Vecchia 2007 Pieve dei Monaci (Maremma),"Sweet pipe tobacco and red cherry open the nose of this plush Syrah from Maremma, Tuscany. Soft, chewy tannins make this inky red wine appropriate to pair with grilled porcini mushrooms or veal in cream sauce.",Pieve Vecchia,Italy,90,,Syrah
101689,Piña 2007 Mimbre Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"As soft and smooth as velvet, with superripe flavors of chocolate, blackberry and cherry pie filling, currants, cassis and sweetly toasted oak. A best blend of vineyards available to the winery, this Cab was aged in 100% new French oak. The alcohol level is high, leading to questions of ageability.",Piña,US,90,115,Cabernet Sauvignon
101690,Qupé 2009 Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Grenache (Edna Valley),"Lots of tannins and acidity on this dry Grenache, but it's so rich and sweet in cherries, you can drink it now. Somehow manages to be fun and serious at the same time. A real success for this finicky variety in California.",Qupé,US,90,35,Grenache
101691,Qupé 2010 Bien Nacido Cuvée White (Santa Maria Valley),"An unusual blend of Viognier and Chardonnay, the wine is brilliantly dry and crisp. It's rich and spicy in citrus, tropical fruit and spice flavors, brightened with bracing acidity. Opulent, yet crisp and refreshing.",Qupé,US,90,20,White Blend
101692,Tardieu-Laurent 2009 Vieilles Vignes White (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"Rich and broad in the mouth, with notes of honeyed citrus reminiscent of tangerine and a tang of peppery spice.

101693,Tessa Marie 2009 Grenache Blanc (Santa Barbara County),"Rich and opulent, showing masses of honeydew melon, orange crème, vanilla and spicy flavors. Really seductive, so easy to like. A touch of oak adds just the right note of smoke. Great with roast pork.",Tessa Marie,US,90,18,Grenache Blanc
101694,Türk 2008 Eiswein 375ml Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"With fruit picked on January 7, 2009, this superrich wine shines with acidity that picks out the fuller honey flavors.

101695,Ugly Duckling 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"In a word, wow. What a wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon.

Drink now.",Ugly Duckling,US,90,12,Cabernet Sauvignon
101696,Finca Vides 2009 Torcidas Malbec (Mendoza),"Solid and smooth from the beginning, with cola, pastry and blackberry aromas.

Right on the spot for value-priced Malbec.",Finca Vides,Argentina,90,15,Malbec
101697,Petra 2003 Quercegobbe Merlot (Toscana),"The fruit appears very ripe, almost too ripe, making the wine difficult to pair with food because of the width and intensity of its jammy nose. Yet more harmonious tones of chocolate, coffee and spice kick in at the rear to add dimension.",Petra,Italy,86,50,Merlot
101698,Recanati 2006 Kosher Chardonnay (Galilee),"While oak can commonly overwhelm Chardonnay, this is a perfect example of an appropriate balance. Toasted notes of almond and peach pit intertwine with red apple and underripe pear; crisp acidity shines through on the finish.",Recanati,Israel,86,16,Chardonnay
101699,Terralsole 2005 Solista Syrah (Toscana),"As much as Tuscany and Syrah seem to be a match made in heaven, this wine is lower in overall intensity and rather neutral in aromas. Pretty cherry-berry and fine wood nuances are measured and understated. Firm structure and tannins, with a tart cherry note on the close.",Terralsole,Italy,86,85,Syrah
101700,Tommasi 2005 Poggio al Tufo Rompicollo (Maremma),"Amarone producer Tommasi has produced this approachable blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet. The aromas are simple but direct, including cherry, spice and vanilla.",Tommasi,Italy,86,16,Red Blend

101702,Bodegas Cerrosol 2006 Doña Beatriz Sauvignon (Rueda),"This tiny production SB is sweet and easygoing, with canned peach aromas along with pineapple and mild citrus flavors. Roundness and a smooth feel work in the wine's favor, because there's just enough acidity to push the length on the finish. Drink right away.",Bodegas Cerrosol,Spain,86,12,Sauvignon
101703,Dry Creek Vineyard 2006 Fumé Blanc (Sonoma County),"The '06 vintage was kind to the winery's basic Sauvignon Blanc, providing a clean, crisp, dry white with flavors of lemon, lime, pineapple, nectarine and honey, and a zingy touch of tart gooseberry.

101705,Kadesh Barnea 2004 Estate Bottled Reserve Kosher Cabernet Sauvignon (Negev Hills),"The 18 months of aging in 90% American oak really shows in the forward flavors and aromas of vanilla and mocha.

Still, it represents a reasonable value.",Tyrrell's,Australia,86,14,Chardonnay

101709,Vega de la Reina 2006 Verdejo (Rueda),"Starts out sharp and funky, and then quickly you realize that it's showing signs of age. The wine blends sweet and sour notes on both the bouquet and palate, issuing primary grapefruit flavors and some mustard greens on the finish. But the feel is chunky and it's losing its zest day by the day.",Vega de la Reina,Spain,86,15,Verdejo
101710,Villa Vignamaggio 2003 Wine Obsession I Miti Red (Toscana),"The packaging is totally crazy but the wine is more subdued.

101718,Quinta da Alorna 2006 Touriga Nacional (Ribatejano),"A soft, lightly sweet style of rosé, flavored with strawberries and a touch of caramel. Fresh, and flavorful, with balancing acidity, this is a good apéritif wine.",Quinta da Alorna,Portugal,85,11,Touriga Nacional
101719,Torres 2006 Viña Esmeralda Moscatel (Catalunya),"This wine is a “product” in every sense of the word. It's consistent from year to year, and if you know Esmeralda, with its sweet blend of Moscatel and Gewürz, then you know that it delivers simple but pleasant lime, kiwi and cantaloupe flavors with a certain watery freshness.",Torres,Spain,85,15,Moscatel
101720,Renwood 2006 Pinot Grigio (Lodi),"With a honeyed edge of sweetness to the pineapple and lime flavors, this wine also has a zesty acidity that makes it finish with mouthwatering cleanness. It's easy to like, a nice late afternoon cocktail sipper, and good with baked ham or pot stickers.",Renwood,US,85,10,Pinot Grigio
101721,Tapeña 2006 Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Clean, wet, a bit sweet and rather formulaic, this Verdejo has a soft, chummy personality and seemingly more than a dash of residual sugar. Still, it manages to push tasty apple cider, papaya and other fuller-bodied, less acidic flavors.",Tapeña,Spain,85,10,Verdejo
101722,Marqués de Cáceres 2006 Blanco Fermentado en Barrica White (Rioja),"The winery has dialed back the time in oak for its barrel-fermented Viura to two months from five or six, and it's a decidedly less oaky wine than in years prior. Now it shows a controlled lees character along with lemon and apple flavors. Limited in what it offers, but made well.",Marqués de Cáceres,Spain,85,8,White Blend
101723,Bodegas Campante 2006 Versatus White (Ribeiro),"White raisin and touches of lettuce and celery give this multigrape blend some richness but also a bit of green character. The palate shows lemon, green apple and pineapple, and this lean quality is confirmed by the wine's modest 11% alcohol level. Drink now to catch it at its scouring, sorbet-like best.",Bodegas Campante,Spain,85,10,White Blend
101724,Brick Road 2005 Nine Gums Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"Tart blackberry and vanilla flavors mark this bold Shiraz that shows its 14.5% alcohol. There's a rubbery note on the nose that's a bit distracting but should be taken care of by a quick decanting, while black olive and coffee notes emerge on the slightly warm finish.",Brick Road,Australia,85,30,Shiraz
101725,Chaddsford 2005 Barrel Select Pinot Noir (Pennsylvania),"The earthy spice character of this masculine but poised Pinot makes it a unique and stylish pick for red wine lovers. Flavors are balanced, the acids are in check and the finish is delicate but spicy. Overall, a nice wine with class.",Chaddsford,US,85,22,Pinot Noir
101726,Ventosa 2005 Chardonnay (New York),"Layers of round, appealing Chardonnay aromas lead into this nicely balanced offering from New York. Earthy spice and good acidity give the wine both complexity and elegance, and the finish is lengthy. A good wine for solo sips or pairing with poultry and fish.",Ventosa,US,85,18,Chardonnay
101727,Bodegas Riojanas 2006 Monte Real Gran Reserva (Rioja),"For classic Rioja, Monte Real is always a good bet. This offering delivers textbook aromas of dried raspberry and cherry offset by fallen leaves and a pinch of seashell. The palate is still quite fresh, while black cherry, raisin, spice and cocoa flavors finish smooth and long, with a touch of oxidation and a Sherry note for added complexity. Drink through 2022.",Bodegas Riojanas,Spain,92,47,Tempranillo
101728,Château de Malle 2011 Sauternes,"Laced with acidity, this is a complex, structured wine with great freshness as well as a dry core of botrytis. It has a rich potential, closed at the moment but holding dense texture and balance between lemon and honey. Drink from 2019.",Château de Malle,France,92,,Bordeaux-style White Blend
101729,Presqu'ile 2012 Steiner Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"Coming from an extreme coastal vineyard three miles north of Cambria, this cool-climate study offers aromas of blistered cherry tomatoes, Eastern European goulash spices and crushed peppercorns of all colors. It's fresh and lively on the palate, with hints of rose and tart raspberry. At the same time, it's quite vegetal, with green notes that will evolve into more balanced umami flavors from 2017 to 2022.",Presqu'ile,US,92,48,Pinot Noir
101730,Sante Arcangeli 2013 Split Rail Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"From a vineyard 1,700 feet above the small town of Corralitos comes this tasty wine that begins with aromas of smoked apple, lemon zest, honeysuckle and sea salt, as well as a struck-match element. The palate shows flavors of fresh apple, chamomile and a dusting of crushed vanilla, all set against a chalky grip.",Sante Arcangeli,US,92,30,Chardonnay
101731,Sixto 2012 Uncovered Chardonnay (Washington),"A blend of fruit sources used for the winery's three single-vineyard wines, this bottling saw no new oak and is light golden in color with reserved notes of mineral, almond, pineapple and lees. Full bodied, rich and layered with a creamy feel, it's appealing now but should have a long life ahead.",Sixto,US,92,35,Chardonnay
101732,Syncline 2013 Subduction Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre, Carignan, Counoise, Grenache and Cinsault immediately appeals with its aromas of plum, candied raspberry and garrigue, with no oak influence anywhere in sight. It's fruit laden, focused and supple, with a feel that dazzles the senses and pure fruit flavors that just won't quit.",Syncline,US,92,20,Rhône-style Red Blend
101733,Lambardi 2010 Brunello di Montalcino,"Classic Sangiovese aromas of underbrush, pressed powder, violet and wild berry mingle in the glass. The vibrant palate offers layers of black cherry, dried red cherry, white pepper, truffle and savory herb alongside firm but refined tannins and bright acidity. This is all about polish and finesse. Drink 2018–2028.",Lambardi,Italy,92,90,Sangiovese
101734,Le Carré 2012 Saint-Émilion,"Rounded and rich, this generous, full-bodied wine comes from a single parcel in the heart of Saint-Émilion. Black fruits are structured with dense tannins and a firm tension between ripeness and dryness. The wine is powerful, finishing with pepper and spice. Drink from 2018.",Le Carré,France,92,135,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101735,Two Vintners 2012 Some Days Are Stones Stoney Vine Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Whereas many Syrahs from this vintage from the Rocks District show more fruit than usual, this wine is clearly rooted in the stones. It's aromatically expressive with black olive, crushed flowers, mineral, black pepper and an earthy funk. Flavors are silky soft in feel, with a well-balanced mixture of fruit and savory notes that leads to a lingering finish.",Two Vintners,US,92,40,Syrah
101736,Va Piano 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This blend of Les Collines (60%), Lewis (20%) and Portteus (20%) vineyards, which saw 25% new French oak, offers blueberry and huckleberry along with herb and dark chocolate accents. It's supple and soft in feel, deft but with depth to the fruit flavors.",Va Piano,US,92,40,Syrah
101737,Tenuta San Giorgio 2010 Ugolforte (Brunello di Montalcino),"This opens with an enticing fragrance of rose, violet, dark berry and underbrush.

101738,Le P'tit Paysan 2013 Jack's Hill Chardonnay (Monterey County),"Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label. This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal. Its intense energy is a little wound up now, but will blossom with time.",Le P'tit Paysan,US,92,22,Chardonnay
101739,Lisini 2008 Riserva (Brunello di Montalcino),"Aromas of tilled earth, leafy forest floor, porcini mushroom, truffle and ripe berry lead the nose. The palate offers wild cherry layered with medicinal herb, black pepper and grilled sage supported by firm tannins. It's still young and a bit disjointed so give it time to come together. Drink after 2018.",Lisini,Italy,92,80,Sangiovese
101740,Mesa Del Sol 2009 Syrah (Arroyo Seco),"The aging program for this Syrah, which comes from a vineyard near the intersection of the Carmel and Salinas valleys, results in a solidly balanced wine. Pepper, boysenberry and game consume the nose, with blackberry fruit, mint, tobacco and a greenish bitterness keeping the palate interesting.",Mesa Del Sol,US,92,29,Syrah
101741,Ornellaia 2012 Le Serre Nuove (Bolgheri),"This full-bodied red manages to be concentrated and weightless at the same time. It opens with aromas of blue flower, wild berry and a whiff of espresso. The smooth, almost creamy palate delivers a black cherry core while notes of graphite, clove, ground pepper and cake spice add depth. It's impeccably balanced, with velvety tannins and just the right amount of freshness. Drink through 2017.",Ornellaia,Italy,92,75,Red Blend
101742,Analemma 2010 Atavus Vineyard Blanc de Noir Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"This is an extremely rare beast—a single-vineyard, single-varietal (Pinot Noir), single-vintage sparkling wine. Aged sur lie for 42 months, it draws you into the glass with notes of smoke, raspberry, mineral and nutty spices. The flavors are light and lively with tart, racy acidity and a long, lingering finish.",Analemma,US,92,56,Pinot Noir
101743,Bella 2012 Block 10 Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"A deep, dark color, unusually ripe and exotic aromas, and intense flavors recalling boysenberry syrup make this a monster Zin. It's not very tannic or astringent, but the body is so rich and the alcohol relatively high that it oozes power and concentration. This will be great after a meal with cheese or chocolate.",Bella,US,92,45,Zinfandel
101744,Centolani 2010 Poggiotondo (Brunello di Montalcino),"Aromas of menthol, dried flower, ripe berry, leather and savory herb lead the nose. The rich palate delivers crushed wild cherry, stewed plum, cinnamon, anise and a hint of vanilla alongside round tannins. Despite its big, friendly structure, it also boasts finesse. Drink through 2022.",Centolani,Italy,92,45,Sangiovese
101745,Château Bouscaut 2012 Pessac-Léognan,"Meaty and spicy, this wine is in an early stage of development. It has dark tannins that have an extracted, tough character. However, the weight of ripe fruit is all there, promising a rich and concentrated wine for the future. Drink from 2020.",Château Bouscaut,France,92,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101746,Château Couhins 2012 Pessac-Léognan,"New-wood spice dominates the aroma of this wine, given weight by the rich black plum fruits and concentrated acidity.

101747,Château d'Arche 2011 Sauternes,"This wine has yeasty aromas and a light character that brings out springy acidity before the dry botrytis. It is still forming itself around the dry core, waiting to become generous and rich. Drink from 2019.",Château d'Arche,France,92,,Bordeaux-style White Blend
101748,Château Gaudin 2011 Pauillac,"One of the few great values from Pauillac, this 10-acre estate has produced an attractive perfumed wine that expresses both ripe black fruit and great structure. It's not a wine for long aging with its already-fragrant acidity. It has sweet tannins, delicious fruitiness and a lengthy aftertaste. Drink from 2019.",Château Gaudin,France,92,49,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101749,Château Phélan-Ségur 2012 Saint-Estèphe,"As is often the case with Phélan Ségur, there is an excess of wood in this wine. Sometimes it works, as here, because the big, bold fruits are powerful enough to match the toastiness. That suggests a future as a ripe, black-fruited and structured wine with room for juicy acidity. Drink from 2019.",Château Phélan-Ségur,France,92,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101750,Darcie Kent Vineyards 2012 De Mayo Block Chardonnay (Livermore Valley),"This barrel-fermented wine has opulent aromas of nougat, butterscotch and pear tart. Equally interesting flavors stress the spice and pastry notes rather than straightforward fruitiness. It is attractively rich in mouth feel, dry, full-bodied and grand in style.",Darcie Kent Vineyards,US,92,30,Chardonnay
101751,Univitis 2013 Château Les Vergnes (Bordeaux),"Forward red fruits give a good beginning to this light and fruity blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. It is crisp with red currant flavors and layers of acidity. Drink now.",Univitis,France,84,13,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101752,Volver 2014 Tarima Sparkling (Alicante),"Briny lemon-lime aromas are simplistic. This blend of Moscatel and Merseguera is foamy, while good acidity keeps it on a level plane. Ripe, sweet flavors of lychee, honeydew and mango are pure Moscato, while acidity from the Mersequera helps this along.",Volver,Spain,84,12,Sparkling Blend
101753,Washington Hills 2014 Late Harvest Riesling (Washington),"This is a straightforward quaffer. Aromas of herbs, jasmine and stone fruit lead to sugary-sweet fruit flavors.",Washington Hills,US,84,10,Riesling
101754,Finca La Pica 2011 Crianza (Rioja),"From the beginning, this crianza from a very good vintage is lacking. The nose is mulchy and cheesy, with almost no fruit character. The palate is edgy in feel, while leafy, stalky red-fruit flavors are salty and taste of vanilla and caramel.",Finca La Pica,Spain,84,25,Tempranillo Blend
101755,Château Saint-Urban 2013 Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,Jammy fruits conflict with a firm tannic structure. This wine is not yet balanced and needs a lighter touch. Producer is Jean Paul Barre.,Château Saint-Urban,France,84,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101756,Conde de Subirats NV Brut Rose Sparkling (Cava),"Aromas of rhubarb, herbs and strawberry mark the nose. This feels solid and mostly fresh, while flavors of pickled rhubarb and briny plum come with sugary sweetness in front of a salty finish.",Conde de Subirats,Spain,84,13,Sparkling Blend
101757,Crayelle Cellars 2013 Bishop's Block Red (Ancient Lakes),"This wine is a field blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache from Bishop's vineyard.

101758,Domaine Beausejour 2014 Les Grenettes Sauvignon Blanc (Touraine),"Lemon and spice make this a fruity while textured wine. It tastes like the chalk soil from which it comes, very mineral and flinty. This wine is all fruit now and will broaden out from 2016.",Domaine Beausejour,France,84,15,Sauvignon Blanc
101759,Les Rocailles 2014 Pinot Noir (Vin de Savoie),"This is just recognizably Pinot Noir, full of tannins with a tight edge. Bitter cherry flavors and very fresh acidity give a mineral flavor that is only just showing juiciness. Drink from 2016.",Les Rocailles,France,84,19,Pinot Noir
101760,Niel Santofimia 2013 Red (Almansa),"Charred, blackened aromas of mint, licorice and burnt tire overshadow the wine's black-fruit components. This feels thick and dense, with chewy weight. Medicinal, herbal flavors of black fruits are peppery and a bit green, while mint and cough drop notes control the finish of this 85% Garnacha Tintorera and 15% Monastrell blend.",Niel Santofimia,Spain,84,10,Red Blend
101761,Producta Vignobles 2013 Mission St. Vincent (Bordeaux),"While this wine has a strong tannic structure, it also offers plenty of ripe fruit. Acidity is kept in its place, giving freshness allied to warm berries. Drink this attractive wine from 2016.",Producta Vignobles,France,84,12,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101762,Silver Thread 2014 Randolph O'Neill Vineyard Riesling (Cayuga Lake),"Apple and pear notes have a slightly savory tone in this brisk, lemony dry Riesling. Throughout a tasting of two samples, there are lingering tones of rubber and struck matches that blow off gradually with aeration.",Silver Thread,US,84,25,Riesling
101763,V. Sattui 2012 Malbec (Napa Valley),"This juicy red wine offers thick layers of black pepper and blueberry around sturdy oak. However, its opulent beginnings start to thin on the midpalate, veering into sour flavors and a touch of heat.",V. Sattui,US,84,37,Malbec
101764,Ventosa 2013 Riesling (Seneca Lake),"Sweet green apple, lemon and lime notes meld in this off-dry Riesling, somewhat evocative of green Jolly Rancher's candy. Whiffs of smoke and nuts add a savory dimension to this brisk, easy drinking wine. Drink now.",Ventosa,US,84,20,Riesling
101765,Biutiful NV Brut Rose Garnacha (Cava),"Pickled, briny aromas of citrus and berry fruits are modest. On the palate, this is soft and low on acidity. Flavors of raspberry, cherry and red currant are mild, with a touch of bitterness.",Biutiful,Spain,84,14,Garnacha

101767,Cave B 2014 Dry Rosé (Ancient Lakes),"All Merlot, this pale-pink wine offers aromas of herbs, grass and cherry. Though the label suggests otherwise, it drinks off dry, with pit-fruit flavors.",Cave B,US,84,18,Rosé
101768,Château Barreyre 2013 Bordeaux Supérieur,"Too much extraction has given this wine a dry character. It does have juicy red fruits underneath and these should come out as the wine ages. It is likely, though, always to be a dry wine.",Château Barreyre,France,84,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101769,Château Laronde Désormes 2013 Bordeaux Supérieur,"This firm, smoky wine with fine tannins and ripe fruit is developing well, allowing the berry fruits to come through the structure. Give this wine until late 2016.",Château Laronde Désormes,France,84,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101770,Château Los Boldos 2013 Grand Reserve Syrah (Cachapoal Valley),"Flat boysenberry and plum aromas are jammy and a bit floral. This feels clipped and rugged, with reedy plum and raspberry flavors that finish short.",Château Los Boldos,Chile,84,15,Syrah
101771,Château Roquevieille 2013 Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"From owner Jean-Pierre Palatin's vineyards at the highest elevation in this appellation, this mostly Merlot wine is soft and fruity, ripe but with little sense of structure.

The winemaker is Thomas Guibert who also handles Ferrand, Palatin's Saint-Émilion grand cru.",Château Roquevieille,France,84,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101772,Cocobon 2013 Red (California),"A very deep red color catches the attention. Next, strong, wild aromas like smoke and black rubber lead to a rather fruity but still firm and tannic texture. The flavors are more like blackberries and blueberries, but the overall effect is slightly viscous.",Cocobon,US,84,9,Red Blend
101773,Domaine de la Sanglière 2014 Juliette Rosé (Mediterranée),"Soft, ripe and fruity, this spicy wine has attractive acidity. It offers a light texture, pepper and a bite of orange zest at the end.",Domaine de la Sanglière,France,84,13,Rosé
101774,Doña Isadora 2012 Carmenère (Central Valley),"Herbal berry aromas include a heavy dose of spent coffee grinds and oak. This has an edgy, hard mouthfeel and oaky flavors of plastic and vanilla that sit on top of herbal berry notes. A creamy finish maintains the wine's oaky theme.",Doña Isadora,Chile,84,13,Carmenère
101775,Ehret 2010 Bellarina Meritage (Knights Valley),"Dark, dry and puckering with a stewed plum aroma and flavor, this wine offers a depth of tannin and herbal notes. A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 8% Merlot, it spent 20 months in French oak.",Ehret,US,84,22,Meritage
101776,Château de Belcier 2013 Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"Ripe and jammy with attractive soft fruits and acidity, this wine has crushed strawberry and light spice flavors. Drink from late 2016.

101777,Château des Tourtes 2012 Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"This wine is concentrated, with fruit that seems too ripe. Jammy berry flavors are mixed in with dry tannins and a firm backdrop.

101778,Château Donjon de Bruignac 2013 Premium (Bordeaux Supérieur),"While there are firm tannins, this wine also has plenty of fresh black currant fruits.

101781,Helix by Reininger 2011 Stone Tree SoRhô Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Southern Rhône-style blend is roughly half Mourvèdre, 31% Grenache and 17% Cinsault. It's a delicious match-up, with the Mourvèdre underscoring the minerality, and providing grip and texture around the racy red berry flavors of the other two grapes. The wine has a spine of steel, suggesting it will age through 20206–2022.",Helix by Reininger,US,91,33,Rhône-style Red Blend
101782,Capanna 2009 Brunello di Montalcino,"Classically crafted, it opens with a fruit-driven fragrance of bright red berries accented with whiffs of cooking spices and balsamic herbs.

101788,Krutz 2011 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"The vineyard is famous for producing ripe, luscious Pinots stuffed with massive fruit. Many wineries have dipped into it over the years. Krutz's rendition is dry, balanced and full-bodied, with relatively high alcohol framing raspberry, cherry, cola, red plum, exotic spice and sandalwood flavors. It should age well through 2020–2022.",Krutz,US,91,45,Pinot Noir
101789,Loring Wine Company 2012 Aubaine Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"The vineyard is near if not entirely within the Arroyo Grande Valley appellation, and it shows that region's tannins, acidity and ripe, long hangtime flavors. The balanced 2012 vintage has given it tremendously ripe cherry, raspberry, red currant and cola flavors, yet the wine retains an exciting sense of control and balance. Give it until 2018–2019 in the cellar to gain traction.",Loring Wine Company,US,91,50,Pinot Noir
101790,Loring Wine Company 2012 Durell Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"It's risky to suggest aging a California Chardonnay, but you'd do well to stash this away until sometime in 2015. Right now, the wine is all about brisk acidity, oak and fresh, ripe tropical fruit, orange and pear flavors. All those parts need time to come together.",Loring Wine Company,US,91,40,Chardonnay

101796,Bucher 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Since planting in 1997, Bucher Vineyard has been a renowned source of Pinot Noir for exceptional local wineries. Now the Bucher family is making their own wine, with good results. The wine is dry, fresh and keen in acidity, and has considerable weight, with ripe, forward raspberry, cherry, bacon, sautéed wild mushroom and exotic spice flavors. However, it's still too young. Begin to enjoy it around 2018.",Bucher,US,91,40,Pinot Noir
101797,Syncline 2011 Mourvèdre (Red Mountain),"This is pure Mourvèdre from three excellent Red Mountain sites: Heart of the Hill, Ciel du Cheval and Grand Rêve vineyards. Tart, stony raspberry fruit carries a hint of cured meat and straw. The wine displays excellent length and a delicious purity.",Syncline,US,91,45,Mourvèdre
101798,Uccelliera 2008 Riserva (Brunello di Montalcino),"Andrea Cortonese makes ripe, structured Brunellos and this is an impressive effort from the variable 2008 vintage. It opens with aromas reminiscent of black plum, chocolate, vanilla and leather. These carry over to the palate along with toasted notes, spice and espresso. The fruit is supported by assertive tannins that need time to soften. Drink 2015–2023.",Uccelliera,Italy,91,,Sangiovese
101799,Villadoria 2004 Riserva (Barolo),"From one of the best vintages in the last 15 years, this classic Barolo needs to be opened a couple of hours ahead of time to breathe. It's a bit shy on aromas but the palate delivers dried cherry, fig, tobacco, white pepper and black tea flavors. Youthful acidity accompanies silky tannins in this wine that is just starting to develop complexity. Drink through 2024.",Villadoria,Italy,91,50,Nebbiolo
101800,Château Cos d'Estournel 2011 Les Pagodes de Cos (Saint-Estèphe),"Smooth and rich while remaining structured, this wine performs the role of second wine very well. The tannins are already rounded and the black currant fruit remains fresh. It should be ready to drink in 2016.",Château Cos d'Estournel,France,91,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101801,Château de Roquebrune 2010 Cuvée Reine (Lalande de Pomerol),"Solid and powerful, it has a great mix of very ripe fruit with dense tannins. Blackberry fruits, laced with licorice and dark chocolate, contrast with a juicy, lightly herbal element. This mainly Merlot wine is destined for a fine future. Drink from 2017.",Château de Roquebrune,France,91,29,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101802,Quinta do Casal Branco 2014 Terra de Lobos Tinto Red (Tejo),"The local grape Castelão is blended with Cabernet Sauvignon in this soft, spicy and fruity wine. Red fruits and balanced acidity are given a shove by a lightly tannic structure. The wine is ready to drink.",Quinta do Casal Branco,Portugal,85,10,Portuguese Red
101803,Real Companhia Velha 2014 Gewurztraminer (Duriense),"It seems perverse to plant Gewürztraminer in the Douro and this wine is as much a curiosity as it is attractively perfumed. Showing all the hallmarks of the grape, the palate carries flavors of lychee and rosewater, although it all seems muted. The acidity does give a final lift.",Real Companhia Velha,Portugal,85,20,Gewürztraminer
101804,Jean-Marc Burgaud 2014 Beaujolais-Villages,"This light, fresh Chardonnay has lively pear and apple flavors. A crisp texture gives zing to the brightly fruity wine. Drink now.",Jean-Marc Burgaud,France,85,19,Chardonnay
101805,Jean-Marc Burgaud 2014 Les Vignes de Thulon (Beaujolais-Villages),"This wine is light, fruity and with only a slightly tannic character. Aromatic cherry flavors give freshness and bring out a jammy character. It's ready to drink.",Jean-Marc Burgaud,France,85,,Gamay
101806,Jewelry Box 2012 Chardonnay (Central Coast),"Coming in a sparkly package befitting its name, this boxed wine shows honeysuckle and pineapple on the nose. On the palate, green apple flesh and pink apple skins prove tart and ripe at the same time, though without tons of body or finish. It's a solid deal though!",Jewelry Box,US,85,28,Chardonnay
101807,Juvé y Camps 2013 Essential Xarel-lo (Cava),"Cidery aromas are briny. This feels low on bubbles but propped up by citric acidity. Orange and lettuce flavors end in pedestrian fashion, with a note of green herbs. This Cava's moderate, straightforward personality is due to the fact that it's 100% Xarello.",Juvé y Camps,Spain,85,15,Xarel-lo
101808,Lanson NV White Label Sec (Champagne),"Lanson suggests adding fruit to this wine or using it as the base for cocktails. It is off dry, ripe and fruity in itself. A touch of toast suggests this bottling is not young. The wine confuses between crisp acidity and a soft, neutral texture. It will probably be best when it is part of a mixed drink.",Lanson,France,85,50,Champagne Blend
101809,Magnolia Court 2013 Chardonnay (Central Coast),"Lots of stone fruit ripeness marks the nose of this wine, with aomas of nectarine and peach cut by the sharpness of apple skins. The palate is all green apples and lime juice.",Magnolia Court,US,85,15,Chardonnay
101810,Mamarracho 2014 The Issue of Inexpensive Wines is When They Are Not Good Enough Red (Valencia),"Staunch aromas of leather and animal hide ride heavily on top of rubbery blackberry scents. This feels solid but scattered, with cherry and cassis flavors that come across jammy. Rubbery notes and a mild cheesy oak character dominate the finish.",Mamarracho,Spain,85,11,Red Blend
101811,Mantel Blanco 2014 Verdejo (Rueda),"Stone-fruit aromas are the opening, and they're on the full, waxy, fleshy side. This weighs in with low acidity, and that results in broad flavors of papaya and green melon. A round finish, much like the nose, shows a fleshy component.",Mantel Blanco,Spain,85,16,Verdejo
101812,Red Rock 2013 Reserve Pinot Noir (California),"Savory aromas and flavors combine with a soft texture in this full-bodied wine. It smells smoky and roasted, tastes like pomegranate and cherry juice and has a streak of acidity but not much tannin.",Red Rock,US,85,14,Pinot Noir
101813,Quinta da Lapa 2014 Selection Branco White (Tejo),"A blend of Arinto and Tamarez, this wine is light and fruity, with attractive acidity and flavors of apricots sprayed with lemons. It has a light texture and a fresh, lively aftertaste. Drink now.",Quinta da Lapa,Portugal,85,11,Portuguese White
101814,Real Companhia Velha 2014 Quinta de Cidrô Sauvignon Blanc (Duriense),"While more herbal in character, this wine also carries grapefruit, lemon and quince flavors. It is fresh with a steely mineral character that adds some interest. Drink now.",Real Companhia Velha,Portugal,85,20,Sauvignon Blanc
101815,Castillo de Liria 2014 Winemaker's Selection White (Valencia),"This blend of Merseguera and Sauvignon Blanc is modest as a church mouse, with clean but dilute green-apple aromas. An easygoing, round palate offers orange and lime flavors in front of a pithy, citrusy finish.",Castillo de Liria,Spain,85,9,White Blend
101816,San Felipe 2013 Oak Cask Estate Bottled Malbec (Mendoza),"Damp, foresty, stalky aromas are backed by a chunky, slightly sticky feeling palate. Black cherry and mocha flavors set the stage for a ripe finish, with brown-sugar sweetness.",San Felipe,Argentina,85,12,Malbec
101817,Tarantas 2014 Brut Sparkling (Cava),"Leesy vanilla aromas are scattershot and include bready notes of baked apple and pear. This feels round, plump and low on acidity. Flavors of grassy, green citrus and tropical fruits turn bitter before flattening out on a mild finish.",Tarantas,Spain,85,15,Sparkling Blend
101818,Decoy 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"This is an earthy, rustic wine tasting of black cherry, cola and a mention of sage, medium bodied on the palate and softly textured. It will please a range of palates, showing varietal character with vigor.",Decoy,US,85,25,Pinot Noir
101819,Domaine André Colonge 2014 Beaujolais,"This wine is tight, fresh with crisp red currant and red-cherry flavors. It is as bright as a button, fruity with layers of acidity that bring out a perfumed character at the end. The Colonge family has been growing grapes in Beaujolais since 1789.",Domaine André Colonge,France,85,,Gamay
101820,Domaine du Vissoux 2014 Les Griottes Rosé (Beaujolais Rosé),"Fresh and fruity, this is a ripe, cherry-flavored wine (hence the name Griottes, a type of cherry). It is light with a straight line of acidity that cuts through the attractive fruitiness. Drink immediately.",Domaine du Vissoux,France,85,,Rosé
101821,Domaine Pral 2014 Les Pays de Pierres Dorées (Beaujolais),"Banana aromas don't intrude too strongly into the fruity palate of this wine that has a crisp character. Tart red-berry fruits and and bright acidity give the wine a fresh, totally fruity appeal with only a hint of tannin. Drink now.",Domaine Pral,France,85,15,Gamay
101822,Espaço Rural 2014 Alves Vieira Branco White (Alentejano),"Grassy, green aromas give this a herbal, crisp taste. It is tight and tangy, with green fruit aromas and a fresh aftertaste. Drink now.",Espaço Rural,Portugal,85,13,Portuguese White
101823,François Lurton 2015 Piedra Negra Pinot Gris Alta Colección Rosado (Uco Valley),"Salmon-colored and spritzy, this rosé of Pinot Grigio smells stony and peachy. A zesty palate has sizzle and zest to it, while stone-fruit and minerally flavors are salty prior to a mildly bitter finish that tastes of pithy citrus.",François Lurton,Argentina,85,12,Rosado
101824,Georges Duboeuf 2014 Chiroubles,"Structured and firm, this wine has more in the way of dry tannins than of fruit. It presents a fine skeleton without much flesh, leaving a wine that is tight and extracted. It needs plenty of time, so drink from late 2016.",Georges Duboeuf,France,85,20,Gamay
101825,Georges Duboeuf 2014 Domaine du Paradis (Saint-Amour),"This structured wine has a tight, tannic, dry character. It is slow to develop, leaving the black cherry fruits still masked by the forward dryness. Drink from 2016.",Georges Duboeuf,France,85,22,Gamay
101826,Limited by Cambridge Cellars 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),"Forest berries, perfumed violets and pine needles entertain the nose on this widely available bottling. The palate shows dried herbs, tar and smashed blackberries.",Limited by Cambridge Cellars,US,84,18,Cabernet Sauvignon
101827,Loron et Fils 2014 Beau! (Beaujolais),"This wine is totally fresh, with crisp red currant and riper banana flavors—a bright wine that's all fruit and refreshing acidity. The family has been in the wine business since 1811 and today works with some 50 small-production growers.",Loron et Fils,France,84,12,Gamay
101828,Adegas Moure 2013 Tradición Joven Red (Ribeira Sacra),"Damp, rubbery aromas of berry fruits and cured meat amount to a weird ensemble. This is decidedly grabby on the palate, with salty, herbal plum flavors. A leafy, herbal, mildly green finish wraps up this kitchen-sink blend of Mencía and other grapes.",Adegas Moure,Spain,84,23,Red Blend
101829,Bocopa 2012 Alcanta Crianza Red (Alicante),"Oaky, jammy aromas are wayward and slightly green. This blend of Tempranillo and Monastrell delivers heavy tannins on a widespread but unfocused palate. Oaky, drying berry flavors are more bitter than fruity, while the finish is choppy in feel and woody in taste.",Bocopa,Spain,84,16,Red Blend
101830,Cairdean Estate 2011 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),This wine offers appealing aromatics of caramel apple before delving into viscous territory on the palate. Flavors fall somewhat flat and the finish is muddled.,Cairdean Estate,US,84,46,Chardonnay
101831,Cardwell Hill 2014 Blanc de Noir Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The Blanc de Noir name would suggest it's a sparkling wine; it is not. The label also reads Estate White Wine. It is not. Rather, it is a rosé of Pinot Noir, lightly orange in color. Flavors recall a Pop Tart sort of pastry, simple and slightly sweet.",Cardwell Hill,US,84,15,Pinot Noir
101832,Viluko 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Made from certified organic grapes, this wine is both savory and tannic, a tad muted on the nose and wanting in texture. Cassis and pipe tobacco stand out most.",Viluko,US,84,50,Cabernet Sauvignon
101833,Alias 2013 Secret Agent Red (California),"Vanilla and maple aromas lead to overtly fruity red cherry flavors with a touch of sweetness and a soft texture. It's pleasant to drink for those looking for a soft touch, with very mild acidity and no tannin to speak of.",Alias,US,84,10,Red Blend
101834,Bodegas Paniza 2013 Agostón Viura-Chardonnay (Cariñena),"This Viura-Chardonnay blend smells odd, as if musky cologne was blended with body oil. The palate seems caught between heavy and racy, while flavors of candied white fruits, apple and pear come with residual sugar and a sketchy foundation.",Bodegas Paniza,Spain,84,13,Viura-Chardonnay
101835,Bota Box 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"Smooth but tangy, this offers good fresh citrus aromas and flavors, a softer-than-usual texture but a bright, clean character that stays fresh on the finish.",Bota Box,US,84,23,Sauvignon Blanc
101836,Viña Arnáiz 2010 Crianza (Ribera del Duero),"Chunky, raisiny lead aromas come with more than enough vanilla, mocha and creamy oak backing. This has a lazy, baked, tannic feel and heavy flavors of candied blackberry and creamy oak. It smells and tastes forced.",Viña Arnáiz,Spain,84,25,Tempranillo Blend
101837,Good Harbor 2011 Dry Riesling (Leelanau Peninsula),"Grilled peach and almond notes show on the nose, while the palate is tighter in profile, offering apple pomace and lemon rind.",Good Harbor,US,84,19,Riesling
101838,Kuehn 2013 Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Light and fruity, this is an attractive off-dry wine. It has a delicate spice character along with yellow fruits that are seasoned with pepper and acidity. Drink now.",Kuehn,France,84,23,Pinot Gris
101839,Long Meadow Ranch 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This herbaceous Cabernet also contains 17% Petite Sirah but doesn't take that variety's character on as much as it does the more herbal Bordeaux grapes, namely Cab and Cab Franc. Earthy and somewhat austere, the wine is a blend of cassis and green pepper.",Long Meadow Ranch,US,84,47,Cabernet Sauvignon
101840,Mario Bazán 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Almost two years of barrel aging have impacted this wine, which also appears to have spent a fair amount of time in bottle. The fruit is subdued and the texture chewy in leathery tannins that feel dry and unresolved on the finish.",Mario Bazán,US,84,60,Cabernet Sauvignon
101841,Medlock Ames 2011 Bell Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"From the winery's estate Bell Mountain ranch, a stretch of vineyard that reaches through Alexander Valley to the Russian River Valley, this is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, blended with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Tight in cranberry and puckering oak, it needs to air before enjoying.",Medlock Ames,US,84,42,Cabernet Sauvignon
101842,Peirano 2012 The Other Red (Lodi),"With aromas like sweet vanilla and candied cherries, and similarly syrupy flavors, this might make a better after-dinner wine than a table wine. The acidity and tannins are very subdued, so the overt fruitiness and oaky sweetness take over.",Peirano,US,84,13,Red Blend
101843,Marilyn Sauvignon Blonde 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Sweet and somewhat disjointed, this 100% Sauvignon Blanc offers ripe apricot and peach before becoming slightly sour and herbal on the finish.",Marilyn Sauvignon Blonde,US,83,16,Sauvignon Blanc
101844,Zudugarai 2013 White (Getariako Txakolina),"Oxidized, yeasty aromas are not fresh. On the palate, this is spritzy, but oxidation creates a yeasty, bready blanket on top of basic pear and papaya. It finishes flat.",Zudugarai,Spain,83,25,White Blend
101845,Cascada Peak 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),Cinnamon and licorice gumdrop and sketchy cherry cough drop aromas make up the nose on this cloying Cab that also shows hard tannins. Baked berry and brown sugar flavors finish with little sizzle or balance.,Cascada Peak,Argentina,83,,Cabernet Sauvignon
101846,Bouza de Carril 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Tired and oxidized on the nose, this offers just-adequate freshness on the palate, but the wine is losing steam. Flavors of oxidized white fruits and bitter citrus finish dully.",Bouza de Carril,Spain,83,20,Albariño
101847,Eresma 2012 Fermentado en Barrica Verdejo (Rueda),"Gold in color, with a nutty, flabby nose. In the mouth, this is honeyed and mealy, while flavors of creamy oak, green herbs and stone fruits finish bland and soft.",Eresma,Spain,83,30,Verdejo
101848,Montevicor 2010 Garnacha (Calatayud),"Aromas of raw oak, paint and dark-berry fruits lead to a medium-bodied palate with candied, oaky, mildly bitter black cherry and plum flavors. A modest finish closes with lasting bitterness and medicinality.",Montevicor,Spain,83,12,Garnacha
101849,Maximo 2012 Edicion Limitada Garnacha (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Grassy, stalky plum aromas are decent but not overly fresh. Without a lot of shape or body, this modest Garnacha is herbaceous and limited in red-fruit flavors. The finish is gone in a flash.",Maximo,Spain,83,9,Garnacha
101850,Witching Stick 2012 Fashauer Vineyard Zinfandel (Anderson Valley),"Both tart and tannic, it's unusually tight in personality, with a mouth-puckering texture, sharp fruit flavors and astringent finish. While there are too many soft and overripe Zins, this one goes pretty far the other way.",Witching Stick,US,83,38,Zinfandel
101851,Heritage 2013 Estate Reserve Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Outer Coastal Plain),"Toasted sourdough bread and briny lemon show on the nose and palate, with dusty oak and slightly burnt toast on the finish.",Heritage,US,83,25,Chardonnay
101852,Alamos 2013 Red (Mendoza),"Aromas of blueberry and cinnamon smell odd and forced. A wiry-feeling palate runs on punchy acidity, while short flavors of currant and raspberry are oaky and finish with little structure or character.",Alamos,Argentina,83,13,Red Blend
101853,Dopff Au Moulin 2013 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"This is soft and lightly flavored. Fruit and some fresh acidity are there along with spice, but the wine seems muted.",Dopff Au Moulin,France,83,21,Gewürztraminer
101854,EdenVale 2007 Syrah (Rogue Valley),"Volatile and sharp, this well-aged (though current) release tastes of vanilla, maple syrup and cut tobacco. After lengthy aging (48 months) in 60% new oak, the wood flavors have taken over.",EdenVale,US,83,25,Syrah
101855,Alto Cinco 2012 Paniza Garnacha (Cariñena),"Prune and raisin aromas announce ripeness, which comes with woodsy, earthy, murky berry scents. This feels snappy at first, then more heavy and baked. Prune and spice cake flavors are clumsy, heavy and lack cohesion on the finish.",Alto Cinco,Spain,83,15,Garnacha
101856,Black Box 2013 Malbec (Mendoza),"This is stalky, grassy and peppery smelling, with red-berry aromas. Rawness and sharp acidity keep the pulse up as basic flavors of plum and raisin take over. A modest finish keeps the course without evolving.",Black Box,Argentina,83,25,Malbec
101857,Hendry 2011 Hendry Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"An overpowering aroma of cured meat on the nose recalls walking into an Italian deli, something one associates more readily with Cal-Ital varieties. Super tannic on the palate, the wine is slightly bitter and perhaps underripe.",Hendry,US,83,55,Cabernet Sauvignon
101858,White Oak 2012 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This has both a taste of vanilla-sugar on the palate and bristling acidity that demands attention, making for a wine that's slightly off-kilter. The presence of oak is restrained and the finish, in keeping with the theme, quite tart.",White Oak,US,83,,Chardonnay
101859,Merrill Cellars 2012 Cotes du Rogue G-S-M (Oregon),"This GSM blend is soft and muted. It falls flat, with dull fruit and a wash of chocolate.",Merrill Cellars,US,83,29,G-S-M
101860,Feudi del Pisciotto 2012 Giambattista Valli (Cerasuolo di Vittoria),"The nose is rather closed but reveals whiffs of dark-skinned fruit. The diluted palate offers raw, red cherry alongside fleeting tannins.",Feudi del Pisciotto,Italy,83,30,Red Blend
101861,Château Beausejour-Duffau-Lagarrosse 2009 Saint-Émilion,"Fresh blackberry fruits give a smooth wine, rich and with an immediately attractive fresh acidity. It does have the density of fruit along with relatively soft tannins. At the back there is a more chocolate character.",Château Beausejour-Duffau-Lagarrosse,France,94,180,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101862,Château Clerc Milon 2009 Pauillac,This wine continues the upward progression of Clerc-Milon. It has weight and density while also showing sweetness and delicious acidity. A very complete wine.,Château Clerc Milon,France,94,74,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101863,Château Magdelaine 2009 Saint-Émilion,"There is dense, ripe fruit here, although with an austere, serious edge. The wine has firm yet juicy blackberry fruits along with concentrated tannins. It is firm, dark, with the potential for good red berry fruits.",Château Magdelaine,France,94,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101864,Hundred Acre 2008 Few and Far Between Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"So soft and sweet, it's like a melted dessert pastry. Explodes in blackberry and cherry pie filling flavors, with the smoky, buttery toast of oak barrels. Defines deliciousness. The tannins are soft enough to drink this 100% Cabernet now, and it is probably best enjoyed over the next six years before it loses freshness.",Hundred Acre,US,94,300,Cabernet Sauvignon
101865,Monteverro 2008 Tinata Red (Toscana),"Tinata is a sultry blend of Syrah and Grenache, a Rhône-style blend unlike any other wine in the area. These grapes seem perfectly adapted to the little-known region of Capalbio in the southern part of Tuscany and deliver intense aromas of blackberry, leather, chocolate and cured meat. It's plush, rich and extremely long-lasting.",Monteverro,Italy,94,130,Red Blend
101866,Mazzei 2008 Castello di Fonterutoli Siepi Red (Toscana),"Siepi is a gorgeous 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot that delivers intense aromas of ripe black fruit, rum cake, leather, moist tobacco and Indian spice. It lasts long on the palate thanks to its fine, silky texture. This vintage is slightly leaner, but brighter than the 2007.",Mazzei,Italy,93,120,Red Blend
101867,Nefarious 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Wahluke Slope),"Firm and muscular, with mixed berries and cherry fruit, this beautifully defined Cabernet shows excellent penetration and focus. The finish is long, smoky, and carries a hint of gun metal.",Nefarious,US,93,30,Cabernet Sauvignon
101868,Prospect 772 2009 The Brawler Syrah-Viognier (Calaveras County),"A stunning Syrah with 4% Viognier that's almost black in color and aching with deep, dark cherry and black licorice surrounded by a lush, dense herb garden. This is a heavy, rich California Syrah, practically a velvet curtain, that will appeal to Rhône aficionados and anyone with a taste for something big, accentuated by a smoky finish.",Prospect 772,US,93,36,Syrah-Viognier
101869,Quilceda Creek 2008 Palengat Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Quilceda's single-vineyard Bordeaux-style blend is 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, 7% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot, from a vineyard just across the road from Champoux. Dusty and fragrant, it suggests soft leather, toast, caramel and coconut, hiding its fruit at first in a wash of luxurious barrel flavors. That fruit emerges with some hours of decanting, a tart and racy mix of berry and sweet tomato.",Quilceda Creek,US,93,85,Red Blend
101870,Castellare di Castellina 2009 Poggio ai Merli Merlot (Toscana),"Poggio al Merli is a 100% Merlot that shows a perfect marriage between variety and territory. It's an opulent, soft and round wine that is woven tight with blackberry, pipe tobacco, rum cake and a touch of black olive. Velvety tannins drive a long, intense finish.",Castellare di Castellina,Italy,93,75,Merlot
101871,Castro Pena Alba 2007 Picos de Couto Grande Escolha Red (Dão),"Pitch-black wine, very dense. It is spicy with concentrated black fruits, layered with equally intense acidity. Wood, fruit and sweet berries are all there. Tannins surround this firm wine, promising aging over 5–6 years.",Castro Pena Alba,Portugal,93,,Portuguese Red
101872,Château de Pez 2009 Saint-Estèphe,"With layers of wood, this is a structured wine, driven as much by tannins as fruit. It will need time for the dark plum fruit flavors to come through—St.-Estèphe is always likely to be firmly textured.",Château de Pez,France,93,45,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101873,Château Gruaud Larose 2009 Saint-Julien,"Initially wood dominates, but this is a stage after bottling. Because then the ripe, smooth fruit comes in, pouring through with black fruits, very ripe and juicy. As this wine develops, this rich fruit will be its main character.",Château Gruaud Larose,France,93,90,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101874,Doyenne 2009 Métier Red (Yakima Valley),"The Doyenne Métier generally drinks very well right out of the chute, and this 2009 is no exception. Supple and concentrated, this blend of 51% Grenache, 32% Mourvèdre and 17% Syrah is an absolute riot of mixed berry fruit scents and flavors. Full, lush, dense and quite long in the finish, it's a spicy, brilliant bit of winemaking. Can it age? Undoubtedly. But good luck keeping your hands off it!",Doyenne,US,93,36,Rhône-style Red Blend
101875,Gérard Bertrand 2008 L'Hospitalitas - La Clape Red (Coteaux du Languedoc),"It's sad that only 5,080 bottles of this wine were produced, as it's truly a stunner. Dark and developed, complex and concentrated, this wine exhibits such superb balance and finesse, with nuanced notes of minerality, scrubland, whole tobacco leaf, black pepper and licorice root all gracing the dark fruit core of the nose and mouth. It's lush and full on the palate, and medium tannins provide a solid structure, making the wine drinkable now or ready to age.",Gérard Bertrand,France,93,75,Rhône-style Red Blend
101876,Terre del Marchesato 2008 Marchesale Syrah (Toscana),"One of the nicest Syrahs to come from Italy, Marchesale is a rich, inky wine with intense aromas of cherry, blueberry, cola, chocolate and leather. Balanced softness and freshness characterize the finish.",Terre del Marchesato,Italy,93,80,Syrah
101877,Argiano 2006 L'Orciaia (Brunello di Montalcino),"This wonderful Brunello opens with sultry aromas of black fruit, cherry, spice, leather and tobacco. It's a rich and penetrating wine with a soft, lush mouthfeel and a hint of crisp acidity on the close.

101878,Campo al Noce 2008 Syrah (Toscana),"This 100% Syrah from sunny coastal Tuscany offers extreme softness and richness with chocolate, cherry liqueur, blueberry and smoked bacon fat. Pair this rich wine with game meat or stew.",Campo al Noce,Italy,93,,Syrah
101879,Chandon NV Etoile Rosé Sparkling (Sonoma-Napa),"Based on Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this luxe rosé bubbly is delicious to drink now. It's likeable for the array of strawberry, orange and lime flavors, with that savory sparkling wine yeastiness, and the bubbles are smooth and refined. Will set off many different foods, but sushi is a definite hit.",Chandon,US,93,50,Sparkling Blend
101880,Château du Tertre 2009 Margaux,"A wine that continues the impressive rise of du Tertre. It is becoming one of the sure values of Margaux, and this 2009 is both ripe and finely balanced. The acidity boosts the rich fruits, sweet tannins and the warm finish.",Château du Tertre,France,93,47,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101881,Château La Conseillante 2009 Pomerol,"Densely rich, very sweet wine. It has some smoky tannins that give structure, along with a dark core of dry raisin and wood flavors. It has concentration and an opaque texture.",Château La Conseillante,France,93,270,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101882,Chester Kidder 2007 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This ups the percentage of Cabernet to 60%, with 25% Syrah, 14% Petit Verdot and just 1% Cabernet Franc. Released almost a full year later than the other Long Shadows reds, it is well-integrated and focused, with high-toned black cherry fruit set in dusty tannins. Scents of sandalwood drift through, along with cocoa and spice. As good or even better than the outstanding 2006.",Chester Kidder,US,93,50,Red Blend
101883,Dunham 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A delicious Syrah in the classic mold of Columbia Valley fruit. Solid and sappy, it's a mouthful of bright berry flavors, penetrating into layers of licorice, coffee and chocolate. The liquorous finish is rich and balanced, with a hint of heat.",Dunham,US,93,28,Syrah
101884,Patz & Hall 2009 Hyde Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),"The reason why this winery scores so well, year after year, in Chardonnay is because the production team knows how to get maximum ripeness out of the grapes, while maintaining an integrity of structure. The '09 Hyde exhibits this quality. It's fantastically rich in oranges, apricots, pears and pineapples, yet possesses a bracing minerality and fine Carneros acidity.",Patz & Hall,US,93,55,Chardonnay
101885,Quinta de Foz de Arouce 2007 Vinhas Velhas de Santa Maria Baga (Beiras),"A rich wine, full of dark plums, big and dusty tannins and a powerful core of dryness. The wood aging has brought out mint as well as spice, smoothing the rough edges to give an impressive and elegant finish. Keep for 4–5 years.",Quinta de Foz de Arouce,Portugal,93,70,Baga
101886,Tenuta Monteti 2004 Monteti Red (Toscana),"This massive super Tuscan blend based mostly on Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon is thick, inky dark in color and particularly intense this vintage. Black cherry, spice, plum cake and leather are protagonists of the bouquet. The mouthfeel is smooth and incredibly rich.",Tenuta Monteti,Italy,93,60,Red Blend
101887,Henry's Drive Vignerons 2008 Reserve Shiraz (Padthaway),"Big, bold and structured, this is a dry yet mouthwatering beast of a Shiraz, its blackberry, mocha and black olive notes held in check by firm tannins. Give it 3–4 years in the cellar, then drink it over the next several years.",Henry's Drive Vignerons,Australia,93,50,Shiraz
101888,Volker Eisele Family Estate 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A distinguished, impressive Cabernet, obviously the result of fine grapegrowing and meticulous berry selection. It's bone dry, rich in tannins and firm, with mineral-infused blackberry and black currant flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Will develop bottle complexity for a good eight years.",Volker Eisele Family Estate,US,93,48,Cabernet Sauvignon
101889,Angel Vine 2009 The Hellion Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"An outstanding Hellion, 44% Primitivo, 31% Petite Sirah and 25% Zinfandel. It's a complete wine, with a full array of superbly rich berry fruits, a hint of chocolate and fine-grained tannins. Delicious right out of the bottle, but it could be cellared for at least another five years.",Angel Vine,US,93,22,Red Blend
101890,La Chablisienne 2005 Les Vénérables (Chablis),"From old vines, at least 50 years old, this shows good concentration, giving a dense, ripe, rounded wine full of green apple fruits, hints of vanilla and streaks of minerality.",La Chablisienne,France,89,23,Chardonnay
101891,Lake Breeze 2003 Follett Family Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Langhorne Creek),"A product of a hot, short growing season, Lake Folly's 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon shows some slightly overripe notes of cola and prune, but also features a high degree of richness allied to a broad, mouthfilling texture. It lacks nuance, but it is a big, flavorful mouthful that ends with hints of coffee and chocolate. Drink now–2010.",Lake Breeze,Australia,89,20,Cabernet Sauvignon
101892,Longview 2006 Devils Elbow Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Adelaide Hills),"Softer and more approachable than the winery's powerful 2005, this wine offers lush plum, leather and loam notes, accented by a touch of cracked pepper. It's full-bodied and creamy-textured, with a soft finish that invites another sip. Drink now–2012.",Longview,Australia,89,25,Cabernet Sauvignon
101893,Villa Matilde 2003 Red (Falerno del Massico),"Aglianico and Piedirosso grapes are blended to produce a thick and broad wine with an inky black color and notes of very ripe red fruit. It has a sweet, chewy aspect with vibrant, albeit densely extracted fruit and soaring tannins. Try it with a beef stew or similarly heavy dishes.",Villa Matilde,Italy,89,21,Red Blend
101894,Williams Selyem 2005 Hawk Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This hugely ripe Chardonnay is just a little too big for absolute balance. Any more powerful, and it would be over the line. As it is, it flirts with it, with gobs of jammy apricots, yellow pears, citrine and Meyer lemondrop, as well as barrel influences ranging from creamy lees to buttered toast, roasted hazelnuts and smoky honey. The alcohol is over 15%.",Williams Selyem,US,89,46,Chardonnay
101895,Craneford 2005 Allyson Parsons Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa Valley),"Sourced largely from the northern end of the region, this features bold blackberry flavors slightly reminiscent of preserves and marked by dark shadings of cola and chocolate. Yet despite the superripe flavors, the wine remains well structured and retains some slightly herbal overtones. Drink now–2012.",Craneford,Australia,89,18,Cabernet Sauvignon
101896,Feudi di San Gregorio 2005 Greco di Tufo,"Feudi di San Gregorio's distinctive take on the indigenous Greco variety favors a more saturated and concentrated style. The color is slightly more golden and intense and the aromas reveal ripe melon, honey, dried hay and almond.",Feudi di San Gregorio,Italy,89,22,Greco
101897,Ponzi 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This is a high acid style of Chardonnay, reflective of a vintage that was one of the coolest in a decade or more. Crisp and detailed, this offers a classy mix of citrus and apple, wet stone and light baking spices. Hints of nutmeg and cinnamon adorn the fruit, which lingers gently through a citrusy finish.",Ponzi,US,89,30,Chardonnay
101898,Razor's Edge 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale),"A very good effort, this may be among the last great values to emerge from Australia, as smaller crops and changing currencies will undoubtedly take their toll. It's remarkable that McLaren Vale fruit can go into a $12 bottle. Black cherry fruit is presented on a medium-bodied, softly tannic frame, embellished by hints of cola and eucalyptus. Finishes soft, with a fine texture of charcoal dust and lingering cassis flavors.",Razor's Edge,Australia,89,12,Cabernet Sauvignon
101899,Torres 2003 Reserva Real Red (Penedès),"Plenty of new oak is announced via aromas of coconut, mint, vanilla and burnt toast. but offsetting that is lively berry and cola flavors. As it opens and settles in, you get a wall of fierce tannins that aren't likely to fade any time soon. So unless you have years to cellar this wine, it will likely hold onto its hard, tannic personality. Hold another three years, if possible.",Torres,Spain,89,150,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101900,Carlos Basso 2006 Dos Fincas Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Uco Valley),"Blackberry and cassis aromas share the bouquet with tougher, more masculine notes of earth, rubber and char. Once it opens on the palate, there's ripe raspberry, plum and a nod to the black side of the fruit spectrum. Finishes with a mild kick of tannins and the essence of coffee and pepper. A solid blend of Cabernet and Merlot from the improving Uco Valley.",Carlos Basso,Argentina,89,10,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
101901,Daedalus 2006 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Complex mixed stone fruits dappled with sweet cinnamon spice lead into a fairly lush midpalate. The dominant flavor is fresh cut pear, and the creamy texture spreads the flavors broadly through the mouth. A lovely wine to match with halibut or swordfish.",Daedalus,US,89,18,Pinot Gris
101902,La Chablisienne 2005 Côte de Léchet Premier Cru (Chablis),"This is a cool cru, which shows even in this great year with its structure, austerity and steely character. It makes it old-style Chablis, with its green fruits and lively, poised freshness.",La Chablisienne,France,89,28,Chardonnay
101903,Piattelli 2005 Premium Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"Black plum, cola and chocolate define this textbook Malbec. The wine has body, heft and lots of fruit, but also some complexity and character. Flavors of black cherry, plum and cassis are layered and fairly boisterous, while the mouthfeel is firm and just slightly tannic. Just right for red meats and pastas.",Piattelli,Argentina,89,12,Malbec
101904,Strathewen Hills 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yarra Valley),"A crisp medium-bodied Cab with good varietal definition, Strathewen Hill's 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon boasts slightly minty cassis-inflected fruit, vanilla and chocolate notes and a smooth mouthfeel. Supple tannins on the finish suggest this will age well through 2012 or so.",Strathewen Hills,Australia,89,30,Cabernet Sauvignon
101905,Di Meo 2003 Alessandra (Fiano di Avellino),"This boasts brilliant clarity, purity and aromas of orange blossom, pear, melon and peach. It's a tad flatter and creamier than other renditions of this native grape but nonetheless would make an idea match to fish, pasta salad or most chicken dishes.",Di Meo,Italy,89,24,Fiano
101906,Hendry 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Hendry has a good track record with Cabernet, and although this isn't their best effort, it's an interesting, moderately ageworthy wine. It's pretty tough in tannins right now, but the astringency frames ripe blackberry and cassis flavors that linger in the finish. Needs time. Best 2008–2010.",Hendry,US,89,55,Cabernet Sauvignon
101907,Ànima Negra 2004 Àn Red (Vi de la Terra Illes Balears),"Overall this Callet-led blend might exceed its more oaked, richer brother known as Son Negre. Àn has a rooty, oak-driven nose with hints of herbs and tobacco, while the palate is dark and tasty, with blackberry, cherry and cured meat flavors. Finishes with pepper and a lash of leftover oak that hopefully will disappear as the wine ages. Drink now through 2012.",Ànima Negra,Spain,89,53,Red Blend
101908,Botromagno 2001 Gravisano Passito Malvasia Bianca (Murgia),"Apricot, peach cobbler, sticky honey, white flower and macadamia nut color a seductively sweet wine from Puglia, the heel of the Italian “boot.” Thanks to strong sunshine and cooling breezes, Malvasia grapes lose their water mass, resulting in rich concentration and intense fragrances.",Botromagno,Italy,89,30,Malvasia Bianca
101909,Nugan Family Estates 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Eastern Australia),"A soft, medium-bodied wine that tends toward bright, red-berried fruit, this is a solid everyday Cabernet. Cedar and tobacco-leaf notes accent the cherry-berry fruit, while hints of vanilla and caramel linger elegantly on the finish. Drink now.",Nugan Family Estates,Australia,88,14,Cabernet Sauvignon
101910,Shingleback 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale),"A real crowd-pleaser, the 2005 Shingleback may not have quite the complexity of the 2004, but it's still a fun, approachable wine. Cola and coffee notes accent plum and blackberry flavors, while the broad texture coats the mouth with soft tannins. Drink now–2012.",Shingleback,Australia,88,22,Cabernet Sauvignon
101911,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2006 Wetzel Family Estate Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),"For such a large production Chard, this one gives a lot of concentrated varietal purity. It's dry and crisp, brimming with ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie, pear, date and smoky vanilla flavors that finish with real sophistication and class.",Alexander Valley Vineyards,US,88,15,Chardonnay
101912,Summerwood 2012 Grenache Blanc (Paso Robles),"A nice interpretation of Grenache Blanc. Blended with a drop of Viognier, it shows notes of orange and peach jam, honey, vanilla and toasty oak. The alcohol level is high. Drink up.",Summerwood,US,87,25,Grenache Blanc
101913,Steininger 2010 Sekt Pinot Noir (Österreichischer Sekt),"For lovers of red sparkling wine with its attendant tannins, this is a fine example. It has a definite Pinot Noir farmyard character along with tannins, a touch of smokiness, and a definite need for food.",Steininger,Austria,87,32,Pinot Noir
101914,AntoLin Cellars 2011 Estate Riesling (Yakima Valley),"There is a creamy, leesy mouthfeel to this estate-grown Riesling, whose residual sugar is masked with acidity. Tart apple and pear fruit flavors finish with lighter notes of candied orange and citrus.",AntoLin Cellars,US,87,14,Riesling
101915,Calicaro 2010 Les Fauves White Hawk Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara),"Good and dry, with tough tannins that make it hard to drink now. With blackberry, currant, molasses and dark chocolate flavors, it seems like an ager, but may not have the concentration for the long haul. Try again in 2–3 years.",Calicaro,US,87,50,Syrah
101916,Caliterra 2010 Tribute Edicion Limitada Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon-Viognier Red (Colchagua Valley),"Crusty aromas of black fruits mesh nicely with lemon peel and floral scents. The acidity here is noticeably high, which creates a scouring mouthfeel. Short flavors of berry and cassis are shrill, while the body and cushion offered by this blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Viognier are modest at best.",Caliterra,Chile,87,30,Red Blend
101917,Emiliana 2011 Novas Gran Reserva Made with Organically Grown Grapes Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),"Rubbery red-berry aromas blend with spicy field scents to create a true Pinot nose that's a bit strained. This is intense, chunky and slightly herbal, with red-fruit flavors, spice notes and some heat and oak on the finish.",Emiliana,Chile,87,16,Pinot Noir
101918,Errazuriz 2012 Max Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Aconcagua Valley),"Hay, straw, match stick and minerally aromas outweigh this wine's fruit scents by a measurable margin. This is chunky and a bit soft in the mouth, a reflection of 2012's heat. And while it's round as a ball, it's slightly vegetal and bitter tasting on the palate, with grapefruit and bell pepper flavors.",Errazuriz,Chile,87,19,Sauvignon Blanc
101919,Château Belrose 2011 Bordeaux,"This solid, structured wine has black currant fruit, balanced acidity and firm tannins. The wine has a solid texture, a core of dryness and the potential to age 3–4 years.",Château Belrose,France,87,12,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101920,Château de Lestiac 2011 Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux,"Under the serious amount of wood, this wine feels rich and concentrated. Wood spice, a touch burnt, along with chocolate and black currant fruit show both extraction and the need for 2–3 years' aging.",Château de Lestiac,France,87,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101921,Château les Mottes Pradier 2011 Côtes de Bourg,"Solid and tannic, very firm from the opening to the finish. It is based around a dark core of wood and spice as well as more juicy fruit flavors. The wine needs time to round out and bring more of the juiciness to the fore.",Château les Mottes Pradier,France,87,13,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101922,Cor Cellars 2011 E Cor Si Move Tempranillo 24K Vineyard Tempranillo (Wahluke Slope),This is a rare beast from Washington—single vineyard Tempranillo aged in neutral oak coming in at less than 13% alcohol. It's soft and light with notes of red fruit and refreshing acidity that drops off on the back half.,Cor Cellars,US,87,26,Tempranillo
101923,Domäne Wachau 2012 Terrassen Gelber Muskateller (Wachau),"Grape and spice aromas give this wine a distinctive heady perfume. A rare style to find in the Wachau, it brings a fine balance between fruit and perfume with the textured nature of Wachau wines. Ready to drink, or age for a year. Screwcap.",Domäne Wachau,Austria,87,17,Gelber Muskateller
101924,Happy Canyon Vineyard 2010 Piocho Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"Easy to drink this blend of all five classic Bordeaux varieties, with Merlot predominating. It's all about cherries, blackberries, plum jam, currants and chocolate. Not particularly subtle or ageworthy, but very pretty.",Happy Canyon Vineyard,US,87,32,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101925,Viña Bisquertt 2011 La Joya Gran Reserva Merlot (Colchagua Valley),"This opens with a good mix of tobacco, black cherry, cola and mocha aromas. In the mouth, this offers good body, size and balance along with lightly herbal, leafy flavors of mossy black fruits. A mellow finish with a solid structure is a welcome ending.",Viña Bisquertt,Chile,87,15,Merlot
101926,Virna Borgogno 2009 Cannubi Boschis (Barolo),"This opens with evident oak aromas of toasted wood, espresso and coffee bean followed by underpinnings of black fruit and pepper. The palate shows ripe black fruit, espresso and oak. Although it has nice depth, the finish is cut short by by drying wood tannins.",Virna Borgogno,Italy,87,50,Nebbiolo
101927,Walla Walla Vintners 2010 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is a tough, chewy Merlot, a bit of a stylistic departure for Walla Walla Vintners. Perhaps it's the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, or perhaps just the result of the challenging 2010 vintage in the Walla Walla Valley. But the greenish tannins bring a lot of herbal flavors to the forefront, and tend to bury the fruit.",Walla Walla Vintners,US,87,28,Merlot
101928,Pezat 2011 Bordeaux Supérieur,"Dense planting for this vineyard has resulted in a wine that has greater concentration than in the past. The wine has firm tannins, while showing already delicious black-currant fruit. For drinking over the next 2–4 years.",Pezat,France,87,17,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101929,Pico Maccario 2011 Tre Rovere (Barbera d'Asti Superiore),"This is a pretty, well-made Barbera with an invitingly floral and fruity bouquet. The palate shows ripe black-fruit flavors accompanied by touches of spice, coffee and chocolate. This would be perfect with grilled meats.",Pico Maccario,Italy,87,25,Barbera
101930,Robert Mondavi 2011 Private Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),"Mondavi's done it again, produced another very nice Cabernet at an everyday price. It shows classy elegance, with blackberry, currant and mocha notes.",Robert Mondavi,US,87,11,Cabernet Sauvignon
101931,Robert Oatley 2011 Finisterre Chardonnay (Margaret River),"This is a soft, appealing Chardonnay layered with toasted marshmallow and superripe peach. It's round in the mouth and lushly textured, then turns citrusy—almost metallic—on the finish.",Robert Oatley,Australia,87,30,Chardonnay
101932,Shvo 2010 Chenin Blanc (Upper Galilee),"Here's a refreshing and attractive Chenin Blanc that offers clean notes of ripe pear, green apple and honewdew melon alongside accents of cinnamon and white florals. The palate is light weight and vibrant, with lifting acidity that adds zest to the medium-length finish.",Shvo,Israel,87,35,Chenin Blanc
101933,Stroppiana 2008 Vigna San Giacomo (Barolo),"Fruit and spice aromas show dark cherry, white pepper and toasted oak aromas of espresso and chocolate, with a hint of orange peel. The palate has fresh strawberry, coffee and citrusy notes but not much depth.",Stroppiana,Italy,87,80,Nebbiolo
101934,Château Grand Billard 2011 Bordeaux,"Fine, rich black-fruit flavors give this wine a sense of ripeness, openness and generosity. The wood and fruit balance is already fine, showing that it will be ready to drink this year.",Château Grand Billard,France,87,18,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101935,Mitolo 2009 Reiver Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"Mint marks the nose of this otherwise darkly attractive wine. Notes of mocha and plum nicely set up the wine, as do the supple tannins, but then there's a jarring edge of prickly acidity that cuts across the palate and disrupts the flow. There are some nice parts here that don't quite come together.",Mitolo,Australia,87,53,Shiraz
101936,Anakena 2011 Ona Special Reserve Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley),"Tea, tomato, raspberry and spice aromas are typical for Leyda Pinot. The body is a bit light and hollow, but that also means it's not heavy. Raspberry and spiced tea flavors control the palate, while plum, spice and light herb flavors work the almost dilute finish.",Anakena,Chile,87,18,Pinot Noir
101937,Cade 2009 Napa Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"With a bit of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec, this Cab is marked by hard tannins and blackberry and cherry jam, black currant and oak flavors. The finish is gripping, however, it's pretty tart, and you have to wonder if that sharpness will ever age out. Decant and drink up.",Cade,US,87,60,Cabernet Sauvignon
101938,Caliterra 2010 Tribute Edicion Limitada Cabernet Franc-Petit Verdot Red (Colchagua Valley),"This blend of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot opens with fiery, oaky aromas that include cherry, cassis and vanilla. The palate has a severe tartaric shear to it along with clampy tannins. High-toned flavors of raspberry and plum are propped up by blazing acidity, while the finish is herbal and peppery in taste, with a scouring feel.",Caliterra,Chile,87,30,Red Blend
101939,Casa Rivas 2010 Gran Reserva Syrah (Maipo Valley),"A green, minty wave of challenging aromas comes with black olive, coconutty oak and graphite. The palate is bullish, scratchy in feel and tannic, with feral, herbal flavors of blackberry, juniper and wild herbs. Herbal and wild are the best words to describe this Syrah.",Casa Rivas,Chile,87,19,Syrah
101940,Waterbrook 2011 Reserve Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aged in 68% new French oak, the barrel notes take center stage here with aromas of toast and spice. The palate is creamy and full with a viscous feel, tapering in concentration toward the finish.",Waterbrook,US,87,15,Chardonnay
101941,Château Macquin 2011 Saint-Georges-Saint-Émilion,"Ripe fruit, sweet tannins and soft texture mark this wine. It's full, ripe and lightly structured. An attractive wine for its black fruit and forward character. Drink in 2–4 years.",Château Macquin,France,87,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101942,Domäne Wachau 2012 Terrassen Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Fruity wine, light, elegant with a touch of minerality, it shows a fine balance of green fruits and its spice. The wine is all about freshness, crispness, a touch of minerality to give texture. At the end, the fragrant acidity shines. Screwcap.",Domäne Wachau,Austria,87,14,Grüner Veltliner
101943,Hawks View 2010 Merlot (Washington),"It's not easy to get 16.5% alcohol from a vintage as cool as 2010 in Washington. The wine has a grain and grass bouquet, wild and brambly fruit, and plenty of Asian spices. Interesting, though not especially typical for the grape variety",Hawks View,US,87,40,Merlot
101944,Chime 2012 Chardonnay (Oakville),"Not the richest Chardonnay ever, but it has complex notes of citrus, apple, nectarine and tropical fruits, with kisses of vanilla and cream. Acidity gives it elegant brightness.",Chime,US,87,19,Chardonnay
101945,Clos Troteligotte 2011 K-nom Malbec-Merlot (Cahors),"Great value, simple and fruity, this is a ripe wine without wood aging, just bursting with black fruit flavors. It's rich, slightly stalky and ready to drink now.",Clos Troteligotte,France,87,13,Malbec-Merlot
101946,Coghlan 2010 Coghlan Estate Vineyard Block 2 Diamond Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"This is an enormously rich Cabernet. It explodes in milk chocolate, black cherry, spicy plum and sweet, toasty oak flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. Delicious, if a bit one-dimensional. Drink now.",Coghlan,US,87,65,Cabernet Sauvignon
101947,Collier Falls 2010 Hillside Estate Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Made in a richer, riper style, this Zin brims with flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants and brown sugar, like a Christmas fruitcake. The alcohol is quite high. Drink soon.",Collier Falls,US,87,36,Zinfandel
101948,Dumas Station 2010 Cow Catcher Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is a fine, all-purpose red blend, mostly Cabernet, with time in one-third new French and American oak. Heavily charred, smoky and earthy, it's got a fair amount of dark cassis fruit to carry all the barrel toast and finishes with some notes of bark and stem.",Dumas Station,US,87,24,Red Blend
101949,Laetitia 2011 Clone 113 Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Lots of early-drinking charm in this Pinot Noir. It's light and silky, with a modest alcohol level that makes it easy to drink. The raspberry, cherry, cola and oak flavors are delicious.",Laetitia,US,86,32,Pinot Noir
101950,Mancura 2011 Guardián Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Scratchy berry aromas come with a hint of sweet-smelling plastic, but overall this bargain-priced Cab is good and welcoming. The palate has a pure, medium-bodied feel, while flavors of baked berry, cassis and chocolate finish with a mocha taste and mild heat.",Mancura,Chile,86,10,Cabernet Sauvignon
101951,O•S Winery 2009 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Bordeaux-style blend remains a fair value, showing some sweet barrel spices along with opening fruit flavors of red and black berry. It thins out in the middle and finishes with a simple, fruity flourish.",O•S Winery,US,86,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101952,Pezat 2012 Bordeaux Blanc,"A cool, very Sauvignon wine, with strong herbaceous and citrus flavors. It's crisp, showing a bright, tight, slightly mineral texture.",Pezat,France,86,15,Sauvignon Blanc
101953,Purlieu 2012 Le Pich Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"There's a honeyed note to this wine, yet it's crisp in acidity, giving it a mouthwatering savoriness for drinking now. The flavors veer toward Asian pears, peaches and tart gooseberries.",Purlieu,US,86,24,Sauvignon Blanc
101954,SuLei 2010 Les Collines Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Though this is pure Cabernet from an excellent Walla Walla vineyard, the flavors seem rather harsh and quite astringent. The dark fruit is cloaked in bitter, chalky tannins that require some rich food to cut through.",SuLei,US,86,32,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
101955,Valle Secreto 2010 First Edition Cabernet Sauvignon (Cachapoal Valley),"On the nose, this Cab delivers a mix of vinegar, rubber and jumpy berry aromas. The palate is smooth but bland and soft, while flavors of licorice, prune and herbal notes finish easy.",Valle Secreto,Chile,86,18,Cabernet Sauvignon
101956,Binyamina 2010 Yogev Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee),"Yogev, meaning “tiller of the soil,” is a friendly and easy-pleasing wine, with direct notes of cherry skins, fresh cassis and black currant leaf. Medium weight, with moderate acidity, fine tannins and a clean, fruit-driven finish. Drink now.",Binyamina,Israel,86,15,Cabernet Sauvignon
101957,Wild Horse 2011 Unbridled Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"This Chard's oak accents pineapple and lemon fruit flavors. It's dry yet honeyed, that paradox of Chardonnay, with a good burst of citrusy acids for brightness.",Wild Horse,US,86,24,Chardonnay
101958,Robert Perroud 2011 L'Enfer des Balloquets (Brouilly),"Bold and fruity, this is laden with bitter cherry and juicy plum flavors. The tannins are light and attractive, with juicy, refreshing acidity. Age this for a few more months.",Robert Perroud,France,88,17,Gamay
101959,Stephanie 2008 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Rich and dense, this has blackberry and black cherry jam, mocha and spice flavors. It contains 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, which lends the wine weight and body. While it's technically dry, there's a sweetness that comes from the ripeness of fruit and the caramel flavor from the oak, which gives it a sugary, bacony taste. Delicious now and for a few years.",Stephanie,US,88,40,Merlot
101960,Tarara 2010 Nevaeh White (Virginia),"Rich, exotic notes of honey-glazed papaya and warm pear are accented by touches of white flower, graham cracker and lemon custard. The palate feels round and weighty, with flavors that aren't as effusive as one might expect. Acids provide enough spine to keep the palate from drooping, with hints of clove and lemongrass adding interest. A blend of 55% Chardonnay, 45% Viognier.",Tarara,US,88,35,White Blend

102053,Sawyer 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A beautifully accessible wine, polished, pretty and likeable now for its gentle texture and silky tannins.

102054,Sullivan 2007 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Here's a powerful Cabernet Sauvignon, ripe and opulent, offering summer blackberry, sour cherry candy, currant, dried herb and rose petal aromas and flavors. The addition of 21% Merlot brings a candied softness, but it's still pretty tannic, and wants 4–5 years in the cellar.",Sullivan,US,92,55,Cabernet Sauvignon
102055,Tenuta Arnulfo 2006 Costa di Bussia (Barolo),"Here's a very attractive and seductive Barolo with chiseled mineral tones that really help the wine stand out in a crowd.

102058,Cascina Ballarin 2006 Bricco Rocca (Barolo),"Barolo Bricco Rocca still needs a few more years in the cellar to allow for full integrations of its spice, fruit, tobacco and mineral components.

102059,Cavalier Bartolomeo 2006 Cannubi San Lorenzo (Barolo),"Here's a wine that begs a pairing with a truffle dish: black truffle Cornish hen or creamy risotto with white truffle flakes would do the trick.

102072,Vieux Château Gaubert 2005 Graves,"A 50/50 blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this shows big fruity flavors tempered with a dry core of tannins.

102075,Benanti 2005 Lamorèmio Red (Sicilia),"Lamorèmio is a blend of Nerello Mascalese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Nero d'Avola in equal parts that tastes of Indian spice, clove, sweet cinnamon and blackberry.

102081,J Vineyards & Winery 2007 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Ripe and oaky. May fall a bit short on complexity and finesse, but makes up for it in sheer power.

102082,James Family Cellars 2007 Stony Point Vineyards Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Young and fresh in citrusy acidity, with forward fruit flavors of cherries, raspberries, pomegranates, cola, bacon and sweet oak. Good and dry and silky, but immature.",James Family Cellars,US,90,35,Pinot Noir

102085,Morandé 2007 Edición Limitada Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"It's been a while since we've reviewed this wine, so this is a fine comeback.

Good, slightly herbal and long on the finish.",Morandé,Chile,90,22,Carmenère
102086,Newsome-Harlow 2007 El Portal Petite Sirah (Calaveras County),"It's hard to make Petite Sirah smooth and elegant, but Newsome-Harlow has done it.

102091,SuLei 2007 Beet Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A nicely crafted debut from a new Walla Walla boutique. The blend—two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, one third Syrah—is becoming a classic in Walla Walla. This wraps delicious caramel around bright berries and plums. It's nicely focused, smooth and compact, but feels like a wine that will flesh out with a bit more bottle age.",SuLei,US,90,19,Red Blend
102092,J. Portugal Ramos 2006 Marquês de Borba White (Alentejo),"Named after local nobility in the city of Borba, this is a popular brand in Portugal.

102104,Comelli 2006 Amplius Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"Although Pinot Grigios are white wines, you could consider this a rosé instead because of its luminous copper color.

102106,De Martino 2006 Legado Reserva Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"A little sweet, dense and pasty on the nose, and that's also how the wine plays out. It's a ripe style of Carmenère, with brooding but not overly expressive black-fruit flavors. Ripeness is clearly not an issue as it shows no vegetal or herbal notes. Simply big, bold and not terribly unique.",De Martino,Chile,87,15,Carmenère
102107,Eugenio Collavini 2007 Villa Canlungo Pinot Grigio (Collio),"This is a fuller and creamier rendition of Pinot Grigio with pretty aromas of honey, peach blossom and melon that give the wine a fragrant aromatic lift.

102113,Château du Galoupet 2005 Tibur Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Here's an interesting rosé fans of obscure winegrapes will love. It's 90% Tibouren, an old variety indigenous to Provence that's known for its finesse but also for its difficulty in the vineyard.

102121,Anthony Nappa 2010 Bordo Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),There's a savage appeal (what the French call sauvage) to this unabashedly rustic Cabernet Franc that was fermented entirely using wild yeasts. Initial notes of tomato leaf and green stem blow off to reveal aripe red fruit with a gorgeously floral character.

102127,Leese-Fitch 2010 Chardonnay (California),"Easily as good as Chardonnays costing two or three times as much, this is a great value, and with production at 12,000 cases, it should be fairly easy to find.

102221,Zinke 2013 Viognier (Santa Barbara County),"This is tropical, boisterous rendition of the grape, with heavy tuberose, white lily, peach and apple-blossom aromas. The palate combines honeysuckle, ripe apple flesh and pineapple-guava flavors.",Zinke,US,88,24,Viognier
102222,Hahn 2014 Pinot Noir (Monterey County),"Warm aromas of red cherries, star anise and cinnamon greet the nose with inviting brown spice scents on this entry-level bottling.

102225,Fornacina 2006 Riserva (Brunello di Montalcino),Opens with dark concentration and extra flesh and density in terms of texture.

102226,San Polino 2006 Riserva (Brunello di Montalcino),"A rich and sophisticated wine, with loads of dark fruit and exotic spice. It's bright ruby-garnet appearance, with bright acidity and a fresh, lively finish.",San Polino,Italy,94,85,Sangiovese Grosso
102227,Tenuta di Sesta 2007 Brunello di Montalcino,"Tenuta di Sesta is run by a perfect father-mother-daughter-son team and is located in one of the least-traveled corners of Montalcino. The 2007 Brunello delivers sweet oak tones that drive the initial bouquet and are soon followed by bright cherry, vanilla bean, sweet mocha and rum cake. Pretty balsam notes at the back will undoubtedly increase and evolve with age. Cellar this wine 10 years.",Tenuta di Sesta,Italy,94,90,Sangiovese Grosso
102228,Louis Jadot 2009 Petite Chapelle Premier Cru (Gevrey-Chambertin),"At this stage, the wine is all dark structure and very firm. It will need time to develop its full potential as an intensely rich wine. Concentrated and firm, it is powered by tannins as well as sweet red fruits. So age for five years at least.",Louis Jadot,France,94,85,Pinot Noir
102229,Máté 2007 Brunello di Montalcino,"The ripe fruit element is perfectly contained and just short of seeming overdone or jammy. It's soft and round, with loads of oak-driven spice, like cinnamon and ground clove, and plump tones of red cherry, blackberry and plum. What's really nice is the freshness and overall supple texture.",Máté,Italy,94,70,Sangiovese Grosso

Offers wave after wave of Pinot flavor, with superb tannins and mouthwatering acidity. The fact that this is Merry Edwards's least expensive Pinot Noir is amazing and makes it a special buy. Production was 2,370 cases.",Merry Edwards,US,94,36,Pinot Noir
102231,Molino di Sant'Antimo 2007 Brunello di Montalcino,"Well stitched together with a broad, wide assembly of dark fruit, spice and cola-like aromas.

102233,Podere Brizio 2006 Riserva (Brunello di Montalcino),"This wine has some big shoulders. There's a dusty, aged quality, with sophisticated, silky tannins and tertiary aromas of black licorice, dried tobacco, peppercorn and dried berry fruit.

102236,Pessagno 2009 Four Boys Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"You know you're dealing with a great Pinot Noir when it's this delicious right out of the bottle, yet will age.

Crushed black pepper and cardamom also make a brief, but lively, appearance.",Quattroventi,Italy,94,,Sangiovese Grosso
102239,Samsara 2009 Kessler-Haak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Just wonderful, showing the great richness and complexity of a top Santa Rita Pinot Noir.

It's dry, silky and complex, and not only that, it will develop bottle nuance over the next six years.

102243,Coghlan 2009 Diopside Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"While the texture of this Pinot is silky and light, it's dramatic in flavor. The cherries, plums, pomegranates and persimmons are packed together into a dense core of taste, all spiced up with cinnamon, cloves and anise. Feels dramatic and complex, but young and fresh in acids and tannins. Give it 5–6 years.",Coghlan,US,94,40,Pinot Noir

102245,Domaine Leflaive 2009 Les Combettes Premier Cru (Puligny-Montrachet),"While the aromas of this young wine reveal considerable toast, on the palate the wine brings forward the ripe apricot and mango flavors to go with that wood. As it matures, these elements will coalesce with the taut, tense mineral texture into an superb, ageworthy terroir-driven wine.",Domaine Leflaive,France,94,225,Chardonnay
102246,Domaine Leflaive 2009 Les Pucelles Premier Cru (Puligny-Montrachet),"This rich wine balances ripe yellow fruits with intense citrus acidity in a harmonious whole.

102251,Kazmer & Blaise 2009 Primo's Hill Pinot Noir (Carneros),"A terrific Pinot Noir, from a winery compiling a serious track record. Grown on the Napa side of Carneros, the wine shows classic Primo's Hill character, with the blackberry pie, cola, mushu plum and sandalwood flavors accented by a little more acidity than usual. Defined by elegance and complexity, it's an ager, although it's beautiful now right out of the bottle. Should easily develop through 2015.",Kazmer & Blaise,US,94,50,Pinot Noir
102252,Kirkland Signature 2007 Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a big, mouthfilling Cabernet, rich and voluptuous in fruit. Although it's a bit hot in alcohol, you hardly notice it, with the explosion of blackberries, raisins and chocolate-covered cherries, made even richer by smoky-sweet oak. Delicious now and through 2014.",Kirkland Signature,US,87,22,Cabernet Sauvignon
102253,Mantra 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"A bit disjointed, with acidity sticking out, and the fruit tending toward jammy blackberries, raspberries and nectarines, leading to sharpness in the finish. Could mellow and improve in a couple years.",Mantra,US,87,65,Cabernet Sauvignon
102254,Turn Four 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A good Cab, chockful of grilled blackberry, cassis, cocoa and sweet smoky oak flavors that finish rich and spicy. Has some real elegance, at an affordable price.",Turn Four,US,87,20,Cabernet Sauvignon
102255,Viña Cobos 2007 Felino Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Chunky, broad and slightly rubbery smelling, with baked aromas, leather and other more serious scents. The palate is full-bodied and warm, but not all that complex. Flavors of baked plums, cassis and licorice are nice, and the finish brings chocolate brownie into the game. For immediate drinking.",Viña Cobos,Argentina,87,19,Cabernet Sauvignon
102256,X 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Rich, savory and appealing now for its smooth texture and forward flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries and oak. A lovely wine for grilled steaks and chops.",X,US,87,25,Cabernet Sauvignon
102257,Ballast Stone Estate Wines 2006 Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"Not a wine for the faint of heart. Alluring notes of raspberry, blackberry, smoke and coconut set the scene for powerful flavors of strawberry and black pepper in the mouth. Tannins are abundant but polished. The finish is a bit of a disappointment, with a whisper of astringency and a huge hit of coconut. Still, well done and fairly priced. Drink with steak.",Ballast Stone Estate Wines,Australia,87,16,Shiraz
102258,Cantine Sant'Agata 2007 Pro Nobis (Ruché di Castagnole Monferrato),"Pro Nobis is a good example of the Ruché grape (a mysterious variety from Piedmont with some similarities to Brachetto). The wine offers aromas of wild berries and blue violets, backed by medium consistency and bright acidity. Pair it with cheesy pasta dishes.",Cantine Sant'Agata,Italy,87,26,Ruché
102259,Château la Tour de By 2008 Barrel sample (Médoc),"86-88 Barrel sample. Densely structured wine, all rich plums and berry fruit flavors. There is a strong amount of wood, but it is the juicy, just green, character of the wine which is most prominent.",Château la Tour de By,France,87,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
102260,Château Larrivet Haut-Brion 2008 Barrel sample (Pessac-Léognan),"86-88 Barrel sample An aroma that is almost port-like in its sweetness. To taste, the structure is lost in a swathe of ripeness that covers the fruit.",Château Larrivet Haut-Brion,France,87,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
102261,Colle dei Venti 2006 Barbera d'Asti,"Tonic and fresh with vibrant tones of wild berry and forest floor, there is a rustic, almost savage quality to this wine that is really quite attractive. It would pair well with home-cooked meals of hand-kneaded pasta or boiled meats.",Colle dei Venti,Italy,87,16,Barbera
102262,La Chapelle de Potensac 2008 Barrel sample (Médoc),"86-88 Barrel sample. Firm, with a bitter, tight edge, this has high acidity, spice, and a tight layer of tannins. For a second wine, this is not that accessible.",La Chapelle de Potensac,France,87,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
102263,Salis 1637 2002 Canua (Valtellina Superiore),"One of Italy's most interesting and least-know wines, Sforzato di Valetellina is made with dried Nebbiolo grapes in much the same way Amarone is made. In fact, sforzato means “forced” in Italian and alludes to the extra concentration given to the wine. With herbal and some bitter, leafy green notes, it's not a wine for everyone; it's sour in the mouth with an acid-driven close.",Salis 1637,Italy,87,40,Nebbiolo
102264,La Scolca 2004 Pinot Nero (Oltrepò Pavese),"There's a tonic quality to this Pinot Nero that combines ashy mineral notes with wild berries, toasted almonds and blue flowers. There's also a warm, sun-drenched quality that adds to the overall intensity and concentration.",La Scolca,Italy,87,26,Pinot Nero
102265,Château Malescasse 2008 Barrel sample (Haut-Médoc),"86-88 Barrel sample. Despite its initial edge of bitterness, this develops as a dense wine, packed with dark high toast and blackberry jelly flavors. The final bite of high extract spoils the finish.",Château Malescasse,France,87,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
102266,Proidl 2008 Senftenberger Freiheit Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"This is the lightest of the Grüners from Proidl, offering a refreshing burst of crisp acidity along with the freshest spice. There is a fine tang of lemon, to keep the whole wine as bright as possible.",Proidl,Austria,87,13,Grüner Veltliner
102267,Seventy Five Wine Co. 2006 Amber Knolls Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County),"Andy Beckstoffer is starting to release wines from his Red Hills vineyards, and this release is promising, especially at this price. It's fruity and tasty in blackberries and cherries, while oak adds rich notes of caramel and vanilla. Rich and savory, this Cab delivers lots to like.",Seventy Five Wine Co.,US,87,20,Cabernet Sauvignon
102268,St. Francis 2007 Rowe Vineyard Old Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Here's a lusty, rugged Zinfandel marked by strong, superripe flavors. The blackberries and plums veer into currants and raisins, and finish spicy and dry, while enormously high alcohol gives the impression of heat. But that's Zinfandel for you. Needs a grilled flank steak to play against.",St. Francis,US,87,40,Zinfandel
102269,Stephen's 2006 Stromsoe Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"Made in a lighter style, this silky Pinot Noir has crisp acidity accentuating flavors of cherries, red licorice and cola. It's an elegant wine for drinking now.",Stephen's,US,87,30,Pinot Noir
102270,Adobe Road 2006 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Here's a big, bold Zinfandel that shows the variety's rustic, briary character. It's dry and tannic and rather high in alcohol, with flavors of wild, ripe forest berries, peppery spices, currants, bacon and sweet, smoky cedar. Nice now with BBQ.",Adobe Road,US,87,35,Zinfandel
102271,Arrowood 2007 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"Rich in fruit and oak, but balanced with crisp acidity. It's strongly flavored, brimming with pineapple jam, white peach, apricot, buttered toast and vanilla. Gets the Chardonnay job done with some elegance.",Arrowood,US,87,30,Chardonnay
102272,Cameron Hughes 2005 Lot 119 Meritage (Alexander Valley),"A very nice Bordeaux-style blend ready to drink now. It's soft, dry and complex, offering waves of blackberries, black currants, blueberries, cedar and herbs, wrapped into fine, rich tannins.",Cameron Hughes,US,87,15,Meritage
102273,Vino z Czech 2011 Welschriesling (Moravia),"Smoke and struck-flint notes add a dark tone to this savory, herb-inflected white wine. The palate is round and rich, and finishes with a reverberating hint of salt and bitter lemon rind.",Vino z Czech,Czech Republic,85,25,Welschriesling

102275,Banshee Wines 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"Sweet-pea and citrus flavors are pleasant, along with a welcome touch of creamy oak for richness. But there's also hints of green, unripe fruit in this dry, crisp Sauvignon Blanc.",Banshee Wines,US,85,18,Sauvignon Blanc
102276,Bindi Sergardi 2010 Chianti Classico,"Oak dominates the overall character of this wine, with forward notes of toasted wood, tobacco leaf, roasted coffee bean and a hint of plum. There's more wood than fruit here.",Bindi Sergardi,Italy,85,20,Red Blend
102277,Corte alla Flora 2011 Rosso di Montepulciano,"Made from Sangiovese and a bit of Colorino, this has an earthy nose of truffle and underbrush, with a hint of iris and a whiff of leather. Reflecting the forward nature of the vintage, the palate is soft and warm, with sweet wild cherry, plum and round tannins. Drink soon.",Corte alla Flora,Italy,85,12,Red Blend
102278,Alpamanta 2009 Estate Malbec (Mendoza),"There's no denying the fact that this smells stalky and burnt, with leathery fruit aromas. In the mouth, it's choppy, with scratchy acidity leading to a loud flavor profile with stalky berry, raisin and stewed flavors. Heat and additional roasted notes drive the finish on this Malbec.",Alpamanta,Argentina,85,29,Malbec
102279,Buena Vista 2011 The Count Founder's Red (Sonoma County),"This blend of undisclosed varieties is a charming red wine to drink now. It's dry, smooth and ripe in blackberry, cherry, currant and spice flavors. Beef is its natural partner.",Buena Vista,US,85,20,Red Blend
102280,Domaine Robert Klingenfus 2010 Signature Pinot Noir (Alsace),"Light in color, this is a fruity, softly tannic and lightweight wine. It brings out red fruits that are now maturing, giving spice and a touch of pepper with final acidity. Drink now.",Domaine Robert Klingenfus,France,85,17,Pinot Noir
102281,Dominican Oaks 2010 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"There is loads of freshly crushed black pepper in this dry, robust Zin. It's almost enough to make you sneeze. You'll also find good blackberry fruit and heady alcohol. Drink up.",Dominican Oaks,US,85,17,Zinfandel
102282,Emerson 2012 Viognier (Willamette Valley),"Light to the point of being a bit dilute, this Viognier has a cotton-candy character, like spun sugar around rhubarb. The tart, not quite fully ripe fruit brings it to a quick, acidic finish.",Emerson,US,85,20,Viognier
102283,Fattoria di Montecchio 2010 Chianti Classico,"This shows delicate floral aromas along with dominant bell pepper and sawdust sensations. The palate is dominated by oaky flavors of roasted coffee beans and espresso, giving the wine an anonymous personality and style.",Fattoria di Montecchio,Italy,85,15,Red Blend
102284,Girardet 2011 Chardonnay (Umpqua Valley),"Aged mostly in stainless steel with a touch of new French oak (10%), this has notes of toast and char along with freshly cut mango. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied, drinking just a hair off dry with a bitter note on the finish.",Girardet,US,85,15,Chardonnay
102285,Lusco 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Albariño is a fragile style of white wine and some just don't age well. This is one of those wines; it's slightly past peak maturity, as evidenced by wheaty, yeasty aromas. The palate finishes with a hint of bitter citrus pith.",Lusco,Spain,85,34,Albariño
102286,Damalisco 2008 Crianza (Toro),"After opening with reedy, stalky aromas, this is raw and choppy on the palate. Flavors of herbal red plum and rhubarb conclude with tight, edgy acids and a bit of burn and heat. This is fresh and generally pretty good, but it lacks Toro's usual richness and power.",Damalisco,Spain,85,25,Tinta de Toro
102287,Hill Wine Company 2010 Black Dog Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a rustic but likeable wine. It's dry, tannic and full-bodied, with good varietal flavors of black currants, dark chocolate and sweet, smoky oak. Drink soon.",Hill Wine Company,US,85,25,Cabernet Sauvignon

102289,Vino z Czech NV Cabernet Moravia (Moravia),"The Cabernet Moravia grape is a cross between Cabernet Franc and Zweigelt. Here, it incorporates all of Cab Franc's leafy herbaceousness and Zweigelt's tart, cranberry flavors in a refreshing wine.

102291,Cameron Hughes 2010 Lot 362 Red (California),"A common, country-style wine, rich in cherries, cola and spices, with lusty tannins. It's lush and simple, but will rise to the occasion with a cheeseburger. The blend is Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Graciano.",Cameron Hughes,US,84,16,Red Blend
102292,Casarena 2011 Estate Bottled Malbec (Mendoza),"This is exceedingly ripe tasting, with a syrupy texture. Along the way, you'll encounter tar and rubber aromas in front of flavors such as carob, vanilla and stewed berry fruits. A minty, oaky finish is the final weighty act.",Casarena,Argentina,84,17,Malbec
102293,Ciringa 2011 Fosilni Breg Sauvignon Blanc (Slovenia),"Earthy with hints of roasted nuts and dried herb, this is a uniquely savory Sauvignon that would pair well with herb-accented fowl and fish.

102294,La Calonica 2006 Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,"This deeply saturated wine opens with a nice balance of ripe, chewy fruit, vanilla and spice.

102295,Lingenfelder 2007 Freinsheimer Musikantenbuckel Kabinett Riesling (Pfalz),"An atypically light, delicate style of Riesling for the Pfalz, with lime and floral notes on the nose and a filigreed interplay of residual sugar and lithe acidity that lingers on the finish.",Lingenfelder,Germany,90,23,Riesling
102296,Marchesi Antinori 2004 Pian delle Vigne (Brunello di Montalcino),"Pian delle Vigne's 2004 Brunello is worlds apart from the scorching hot 2003 vintage—so different, in fact, the wine seems utterly reborn.

102297,Mazzei 2007 Fonterutoli (Chianti Classico),"Bold and modern, Fonterutoli delivers the goods year after year. The wine is rich and plush with deep concentration and excellent intensity.

102299,Edmonds Winery 2007 Solstice Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"The fruit scents explode from the glass, showing raspberries, blueberries, cherries and plums in profusion. There is more stuffing, especially apparent in the nose and also in the mouth, than in the winery's varietal blends. The back end of the wine suggests bread and chocolate, light hints of toasted almond and cinnamon spice.",Edmonds Winery,US,90,40,Red Blend
102300,Fitz-Ritter 2006 Beerenauslese Rieslaner (Pfalz),"Verging on orange in color, this intensely botrytized wine from one of Germany's unique grape varieties is thick, almost chewy with extract and sugar. Dried apricot aromas lead into orange marmalade flavors with an almost burnt, caramelized quality. Finishes long, with a hint of bitterness that helps balance some of the intense sweetness.",Fitz-Ritter,Germany,90,47,Rieslaner
102301,Georg Mosbacher 2007 Forster Musenhang Spätlese Trocken Riesling (Pfalz),"Aromas of peach, lime and mineral make a first-rate initial impression, and are then followed by zesty citrus flavors that enhance rather than overpower the briny minerality. It's 13% alcohol, but maintains a wonderful balance of alcohol, acid and just a hint of sugar. Long and mouthwatering on the finish.",Georg Mosbacher,Germany,90,36,Riesling
102302,Highlands 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Compared to Highlands' regular Cab, this is a great example of sometimes, more is less. The '06 Reserve is a gigantic wine, both in ripely extracted currants and in the taste of new, smoky oak. But it's very size makes it ponderous. The question is one of ageability. It could well be a sleeper. Try beyond 2010.",Highlands,US,90,75,Cabernet Sauvignon
102303,Vergelegen 2005 Mill Race Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Stellenbosch),"The nose has a ripe plum and savory spice character in this sophisticated red.

102305,Cameron Hughes 2006 Lot 113 Syrah (Mount Veeder),"Negociant Hughes continues to produce compelling wines at everyday prices.

102309,Crane Brothers 2005 Crane Ranch Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"Here's a strongly flavored Merlot, made with ultraripe fruit. If it didn't have a good structure, the blackberry, currant, mocha and anise flavors alone would make it a fruit bomb. Fortunately, fine acidity and gorgeously thick tannins give it structure and backbone. Best for a year or two.",Crane Brothers,US,90,30,Merlot
102310,García Figuero 2004 Tinto Figuero 15 Reserva (Ribera del Duero),"One sniff announces a wood pile's worth of toasty, dusty oak. But there's all the bold Tempranillo fruit and classic RDD terroir here to absorb it. Ripe as can be on the palate, with equal parts mulled black fruit, spice and mocha. It finishes smooth, with generous extract but nothing grating or grabby. Drink now through 2012.",García Figuero,Spain,90,54,Tempranillo Blend

102313,Picardy 2006 Chardonnay (Pemberton),"From a little-known region of Western Australia, this is a restrained, structured example of Chardonnay that may drink well for 5–6 years.

102468,Château Tour de Pez 2012 Saint-Estèphe,"The small area of Pez is one of the top sites in Saint-Estèphe, with many highly rated chateaus. This is one.

102552,Terrazas de Los Andes 2013 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),"Strapping currant and berry aromas come with a full dosage of toasty oak. This Malbec feels sinewy, with good depth. Oaky notes of toast and blackened spice lend a chocolaty essence to berry and plum flavors, while this finishes with an herbal, spicy aftertaste.",Terrazas de Los Andes,Argentina,89,20,Malbec
102553,Avant 2014 Fresh Crisp Clean Chardonnay (California),"Lots of fresh apple flavors, a crisp balance and smooth mouthfeel make this light-bodied wine refreshing and fun to drink. It has some richness on the midpalate and finish, but basically keeps its lively, tangy personality going.",Avant,US,89,17,Chardonnay
102554,Barton 2014 The River White (Central Coast),"Sharp aromas of peach blossoms, honeyed nuts and lemon balm make for a fruity yet biting nose on this blend of 58% Grenache Blanc from Happy Canyon and 42% Viognier from San Luis Obispo County. Ripened stonefruit flavors are cut with a sizzle of acidity and warmth of sea salt and candied Meyer lemon on the palate.",Barton,US,89,24,Rhône-style White Blend
102555,Brick & Mortar 2013 La Perla Vineyard Pinot Noir (Spring Mountain District),"A clear, light-bodied wine that's slightly reduced on the nose, this Spring Mountain site provides a tightness of black tea and cherry cola, with a leanness that's hard to miss. Leather, currant and baked bread add additional complexity and intrigue.",Brick & Mortar,US,89,55,Pinot Noir
102556,One 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),"A 100% varietal wine entirely from Yountville, this presents a touch of herb and cedar on the entry aromatically, followed by a thickness of tannin that softens in the glass. Big-boned, it finishes strong in tobacco and coffee.",One,US,89,45,Cabernet Sauvignon
102557,Pace 2013 Sebastiano Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Simultaneously light yet earthy, this shows cherry pie, concentrated pomegranate, whole nutmeg, buttery crust and intriguing brown spices on the nose. There is a bit less action on the palate, but still plenty of tart cherries, tobacco and brown spice elements.",Pace,US,89,45,Pinot Noir
102558,Jason-Stephens 2010 Estate Merlot (Santa Clara Valley),"Blueberry, grapeseed, leather, cigar box and concentrated lavender combine for an elegantly intriguing nose on this bottling from a winery between Morgan Hill and Gilroy. The palate is fresh and rather light, with plums, figs, crushed peppercorns and a forest floor/pine needle intrigue.",Jason-Stephens,US,89,24,Merlot
102559,Las Positas 2014 Estate Rosé (Livermore Valley),"Fresh and tempting, this has a hot-pink color and flavors like watermelon and cherry. With medium body and even a light touch of tannin, it's more meaty than many rosés, so you can serve it with the meal as well as for an apéritif.",Las Positas,US,89,25,Rosé
102560,In Re 2010 You be the judge! Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Sanguine in cedar, pencil lead and tea, this wine's elegant opening gives way to ripe black fruit and thick, burly tannins. The finish is marked in vanilla oak and a taste of cigar.",In Re,US,89,65,Cabernet Sauvignon
102561,Waipara Hills 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"This is a bold, assertive Sauvignon Blanc, boasting bright citrus aromas and flavors, lifted by just a sprinkling of cut grass. A bit of creaminess adds dimension on the palate, which then finishes on a burst of lime and grapefruit.",Waipara Hills,New Zealand,89,19,Sauvignon Blanc
102562,Two Moons 2013 Aporia White (Paso Robles),"Lightly smoked stone fruit and apple blossoms greet the nose on this bottling of 50% Marsanne and 50% Grenache Blanc. The palate is much more interesting, with lemon sorbet and ripe apples clinging to a steely centerline that shows flashes of flint and gunmetal.",Two Moons,US,89,28,Rhône-style White Blend
102563,Valle dell'Acate 2012 Cerasuolo di Vittoria Classico,"Aromas of ripe berry, Mediterranean herb, menthol and eucalyptus lead the nose. The medium-bodied palate is already somewhat evolved offering blackberry extract, mature black cherry, licorice, spice and espresso alongside polished tannins. It closes on a note of bitter walnut.",Valle dell'Acate,Italy,89,27,Red Blend
102564,Volatus 2008 Reserve Red (Paso Robles),"This long-aged blend of 67% Syrah and 33% Petite Sirah is plump on the oaky nose with condensed rose petal, chocolate cake and violet aromas. The palate starts with ripe black cherries but then settles into an asphalt-laden midpalate, finishing with chocolate-chip cookies and a graphite tension.",Volatus,US,89,25,Red Blend
102565,Zocker 2014 Paragon Vineyard Grüner Veltliner (Edna Valley),"Playful and nearly effervescent on the nose with lemon-lime soda notes and a sparkling pear-cider character, this bottling also shows aromas of pink grapefruit and pink lemonade sorbet. Tart lime and lemon verbena pop on the palate as does melon pith, with a slight herbal character on the finish.",Zocker,US,89,20,Grüner Veltliner
102566,Hannes Reeh 2014 Rohstoff Chardonnay (Burgenland),"There is a high-toned aspect to the otherwise neutral nose that just gives away lemony hints. The palate is sprightly and fresh and reveals a very creamy, fruity, almost tropical core which is cut very pleasantly by fresh, aromatic lemon—this is Chardonnay but not as you know it. A very fruity, rich but fresh number.",Hannes Reeh,Austria,89,21,Chardonnay
102567,Hightower 2012 Reserve Red (Red Mountain),"This wine could be labeled a Cabernet Sauvignon, which makes up 83% of the blend, with the rest Merlot. The aromas of fruit leather, dried blackberry, black licorice and medicine cabinet are bright, though they seem considerably more evolved than the wine's age might indicate. The black-fruit flavors display a sense of balance that carries through the finish. Drink now.",Hightower,US,89,55,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
102568,Full Pull & Friends 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Already six years old, this wine offers aromas of black licorice, dried cherry, vanilla, clove and abundant wood spices.

102569,Gamache 2011 Estate Grown Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas of blue and purple fruit mix with notes of dried thyme and black pepper. The flavors are tart and elegant, showing a good sense of balance and restraint, with a finish that lingers.",Gamache,US,89,30,Malbec

102571,Pala 2013 Assoluto White (Isola dei Nuraghi),"Made with 80% Nasco and 20% Vermentino, this offers delicate aromas of marzipan, dried apricot and wildflower honey. On the sweet, full-bodied palate, notes of white almond back up acacia honey and tangerine zest.",Pala,Italy,89,45,White Blend
102572,14 Hands 2013 Reserve M-S-G-V Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Mourvèdre and Syrah each make up a third of this wine with the rest Grenache and Viognier. The latter (12%) shows itself prominently on the aromas, with perfumed notes of purple flowers and orange peel that are followed by purple fruit, vanilla, coffee and spice. The palate offers elegant, yet sweet and flavorful pomegranate and cranberry flavors with pleasing spice accents.",14 Hands,US,89,30,Rhône-style Red Blend
102573,Amavi 2014 Semillon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Honeycomb, fig and herb aromas are followed by textured flavors that show intensity and persistence.",Amavi,US,89,24,Sémillon
102574,Basilisco 2011 Teodosio (Aglianico del Vulture),"This fragrant red opens with lovely scents of perfumed berry, blue flower and Oriental spice while the polished palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry, anise and clove. Fine-grained tannins give the finish grip.",Basilisco,Italy,89,20,Aglianico
102575,Bontzu 2013 Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Vanilla, thyme, dill and plum aromas are followed by plentiful fruit and barrel flavors that possess a pleasing mouthfeel. The oak is out front at times, especially on the aromas, but the wine is appealing.",Bontzu,US,89,30,Malbec
102576,Burrell School Vineyards 2011 Honor Roll Estate Reserve Merlot (Santa Cruz Mountains),"A mountaintop vineyard in a cool year delivers the expected lighter elegance, offering a complicated and fascinating array of aromas, from incense and white pepper to patchouli and potpourri. The palate starts with sour cherries before the herbal lift of fennel and dill arrives, proving a light, curious and tasty wine.",Burrell School Vineyards,US,89,32,Merlot
102577,Stottle 2012 Big Eddie Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Merlot (55%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (40%) make up the majority of this wine with the balance Malbec. Vanilla, barrel spice and dark-fruit aromas are followed by saturated black-fruit flavors that linger. The oak gets a bit out-front but the wine still has much to offer.",Stottle,US,89,35,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
102578,Stottle 2012 Elerding 6 Prong Malbec (Horse Heaven Hills),"Blue-fruit aromas intermingle with vanilla and other barrel spices. The coffee and plum flavors are full and supple in feel, followed by a tart finish. The wood seems a bit primary but the fruit and feel is still hard to ignore.",Stottle,US,89,33,Malbec
102579,àMaurice 2013 Fred Estate Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Bright aromas of freshly roasted coffee beans, brown stems, dried herbs, purple flowers, mineral and black pepper are followed by ethereally light fruit and savory flavors that focus on elegance. This wine provides plenty of interest but the finish seems a bit clipped. It might lengthen out with aging.",àMaurice,US,89,45,Syrah
102580,àMaurice 2014 Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, this warm-vintage wine seems aromatically quiet, with light aromas of funk, earth, red berries and coffee. Flavors are generous and ripe, with the alcohol occasionally poking out.",àMaurice,US,89,45,Syrah
102581,àMaurice 2014 Boushey Vineyard Marsanne-Viognier (Yakima Valley),"The aromas of flowers, mineral, peach and almond are initially light but pleasing. The stone-fruit flavors are full bodied and sweet, pulling up ever so slightly on the finish.",àMaurice,US,89,35,Marsanne-Viognier
102582,Amavi 2013 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Les Collines and Stone Valley fruit make up 75% of this wine with the rest coming from Seven Hills, Pepper Bridge and Summit View. It offers generous aromas of blueberry puree, dried herbs, red fruit, woodspice, dried flowers and mineral. The flavors bring the same but are more pulled-back than the aromas suggest, with a bit of astringency that holds the wine back.",Amavi,US,89,32,Syrah
102583,Brian Carter Cellars NV One Upland Vineyard Touriga Nacional (Snipes Mountain),"Examples of this variety are rare in the state. Aromas pop with heaping amounts of fresh flowers and orange peel that are reminiscent of freesia in their intensity. The coffee and blue-fruit flavors are smooth and sultry, showing pleasing depth.",Brian Carter Cellars,US,89,50,Touriga Nacional
102584,Charthia 2013 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Specks of rosemary give the aromatic entry of this wine a nice herbal invitation. This subtlety is followed by more bombastic waves of big, juicy black cherry, berry and oak. The tannins are still substantial, suggesting cellaring, through 2021.",Charthia,US,89,45,Pinot Noir
102585,Château de Chantegrive 2013 Graves,"The gravel soil on this Lévèque family property makes a great place to grow white grapes. A 50/50 blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon, this fresh wine suggests the ability to age. It is fruity now, hinting at apricots as well as citrus. It can be drunk now for its freshness, although wait until late 2016 for it to develop greater depths.",Château de Chantegrive,France,89,20,Bordeaux-style White Blend
102586,Château Mayne Vieil 2011 Cuvée Aliénor (Fronsac),"Spice and ripe fruit, with attractive tannins and a soft texture. This wine is open, generous, rich and packed with black currant fruitiness. Give this wine another 2–4 years, but it could well be drinkable sooner.",Château Mayne Vieil,France,90,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
102587,F X Pichler 2012 Loibner Klostersatz Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"This is a crisp, but also rich style of Federspiel. It is full of ripe pear and apple flavor as well as a fine pinch of pepper. Acidity creeps in the background to balance this ready-to-drink wine. Screwcap.",F X Pichler,Austria,90,,Grüner Veltliner
102588,Frankland Estate 2012 Poison Hill Vineyard Riesling (Frankland River),"The most aromatically complex of the FE 2012 Rieslings, the Poison Hill offers beguiling scents of tangerine sherbet and Earl Grey tea. It's almost too perfumy for its soft, medium-bodied structure and slightly dusty-textured finish, but those floral elements are also its appeal. Drink now–2020+.",Frankland Estate,Australia,90,35,Riesling
102589,Graf Hardegg 2010 Steinbügel Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"This is a serious wine, despite the ripe fruitiness on its surface. It is full of peach and mango flavors, but structured by a cool, mineral feel. Tangy acidity and tight texture adds tension. It still needs to age 2–4 years. Screwcap.",Graf Hardegg,Austria,90,,Grüner Veltliner
102590,A. Christmann 2010 Gimmeldinger Biengarten Trocken Riesling (Pfalz),"Exquisitely smoky and savory dried herb tones calibrate rich, tropical fruit aromas on this dry yet voluptuously textured Riesling. The palate is penetrating with minerality and a soft, elegant lemon-lime acidity. Finishes long and rich.",A. Christmann,Germany,90,42,Riesling
102591,àMaurice 2010 Gamache Vineyard Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Single vineyard, 100% varietal Malbec can be spot on, and this succeeds with a balanced flavor profile of mixed berries and earthy tannins. There's a hint of volatility, that quickly blows off. Decanting for an hour or so is advised.",àMaurice,US,90,35,Malbec
102592,Barale Fratelli 2009 Bussia (Barolo),"This traditionally styled Barolo has a classic fragrance of violet, rose and leather, with balsamic notes. The palate reveals ripe berry and spice with notes of pipe tobacco and while the acidity is tame the wine is massively tannic. Hold this for a few more years, but drink it before 2020.",Barale Fratelli,Italy,90,92,Nebbiolo
102593,Barale Fratelli 2009 Castellero (Barolo),"This shows enticing aromas of mint, spice and balsamic herbs and delivers a restrained palate of black cherry, with undertones of sage, white pepper, coffee and espresso. This is still aggressively tannic and needs time to soften.",Barale Fratelli,Italy,90,82,Nebbiolo
102594,Gamache 2009 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Rich cherry fruit anchors this excellent, estate-grown Merlot. It's lush and textural, with deep, dark fruit flavors and pleasant roasted notes of coffee and smoke. Half the barrels were new American oak, the rest French, mostly new.",Gamache,US,90,25,Merlot
102595,Hope Estate 2010 The Ripper Shiraz (Geographe),"Made in a superripe, dense, almost fudge-like style, The Ripper tastes like a plummy, chocolaty Christmas cake with slightly coarse tannins on the finish. It's Port-like in flavor, but without the heat from elevated alcohol. Drink it over the next few years.",Hope Estate,Australia,90,20,Shiraz
102596,Hirsch 2012 Zöbing Riesling (Kamptal),"Crisp, clean, mineral wine, with hints of a more aromatic character in the background, this is packed with apple and lemon flavors. A straight line of delicious acidity cuts like a knife through the wine. For aging over 3–5 years. Screwcap.",Hirsch,Austria,90,,Riesling
102597,Pelter 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz (Galilee),"This is a balanced and complex fifty-fifty blend, with herbal accents of licorice root, coffee bean and foliage that mingle harmoniously with ripe fruit notes of blackberry, wild raspberry and cherry. Medium weight and lushly textured, but not overdone, with a long finish that delivers light hints of mocha and pepper.",Pelter,Israel,90,39,Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz
102598,Peter Nicolay 2011 Bernkasteler Badstube Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"Wet stone and earth notes add a distinct minerality to intensely fruity peach and apricot flavors on this ripe, but dainty Riesling. Zippy acidity and a flurry of fresh, green herbs make for a brisk finish.",Peter Nicolay,Germany,90,29,Riesling
102599,Plantagenet 2010 Omrah Shiraz (Western Australia),"An easy-drinking introduction to Shiraz from Western Australia's Great Southern region, the 2010 Omrah offers gentle cherry and cedar notes accented by hints of chocolate and roasted meat. It's medium to full bodied, with a round, supple mouthfeel that ends in a wash of softly dusty tannins.",Plantagenet,Australia,90,20,Shiraz
102600,Rheingraf 2011 Trocken Riesling (Rheinhessen),"Whiffs of slate and petrol add nuance to white flower and pineapple aromas on this intensely minerally, dry Riesling. The palate is lush and full with ripe nectarine flavor, freshened with a swathe of fresh green herbs on the finish.",Rheingraf,Germany,90,25,Riesling
102601,Robert Oatley 2009 Finisterre Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River),"There's a lot to like in this effort: ample dark fruit, complex notions of tea leaves and dried grasses, and a richly textured, long finish. The wine is medium bodied and not very tannic, making it easy to sip repeatedly. Drink it over the next 8–10 years.",Robert Oatley,Australia,90,30,Cabernet Sauvignon
102602,Iron Horse 2011 Unoaked Chardonnay (Green Valley),"Ripe, flashy fruit stars in this unoaked Chardonnay, in the form of pineapples, kiwis, limes and pears. The grapes for this delicious wine come from the winery's estate vineyard, in the cool southwestern pocket of the Russian River Valley.",Iron Horse,US,90,27,Chardonnay
102603,La Clarine Farm 2012 Rosé (Sierra Foothills),"La Clarine Farm's rosé is slightly cloudy, sourced mostly from Syrah grapes, with unusual additions of Mourvèdre, Sémillon and Viognier. Winemaker Hank Beckmeyer says the Syrah grapes barely ripen and that's why he likes them for this wine. Light at 12.8% alcohol, it's an intriguing melange of earthy dark strawberry and mint, crisp in acidity.",La Clarine Farm,US,90,17,Rosé
102604,La Playa 2010 Axel Primero Red (Colchagua Valley),"Oak, resin, vanilla and creamy aromas run side by side with cherry, cassis and berry scents on this blend of Cabernet, Carmenère, Petit Verdot and Syrah. The palate is tight, juicy and textured, with good density. Flavors of creamy oak, mocha, raspberry and plum set up a medium-length, strong finish. Drink through 2017.",La Playa,Chile,90,40,Red Blend
102605,Maldonado 2011 Los Olivos Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"This is a rich, robust Pinot Noir, defining the big, tannic style. It explodes in cherry, cola and pomegranate fruit flavors, with the added note of caramelized oak. You can drink this wine now, but it should hold in the bottle for 6–8 years, gradually mellowing. The vineyard is in the cooler southern part of the valley, near Carneros.",Maldonado,US,90,42,Pinot Noir
102606,Medlock Ames 2008 Bell Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),This Cab wants a few more years to let its internal inconsistencies resolve. The primary cherry and blackberry fruit has faded and is turning nutty. But it's still pretty tannic. Needs to throw some sediment to let the inherent fruit emerge. Try after 2016.,Medlock Ames,US,90,52,Cabernet Sauvignon
102607,Morandé 2009 Edición Limitada Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"Earthy aromas include pencil eraser, wild herbs and eucalyptus along with tea and blackberry. This is very smooth and lush in the mouth, a reflection of a warm vintage. Flavors of olive, herbs, tobacco and black fruits are textbook for the variety, while a mellow, polished finish is silky and easygoing. Drink through 2016.",Morandé,Chile,90,23,Carmenère
102608,Ochagavia 2010 Raices Nobles Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"This wine from the Santa Carolina family opens with ripe blackberry, prune and minerally aromas. It's rubbery and deep on the palate, with dark, toasty flavors of blackberry and bitter chocolate. A lightly herbal and spicy tasting finish with medium intensity fades away with lactic creaminess.",Ochagavia,Chile,90,21,Cabernet Sauvignon
102609,Barnard Griffin 2011 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though labeled simply Columbia Valley, this is a classic example of Wahluke Slope Syrah. Well-integrated layers of citrus, berry, roasted coffee beans, vanilla cookie and Graham cracker combine into a most accessible, yet complex wine. It's ready to drink, and should be consumed over the next 3–4 years.",Barnard Griffin,US,90,17,Syrah
102610,Barrister 2009 Bacchus Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Thick, heavy, potent and mouth-coating, this is a liquorous, almost syrupy wine, sure to please those who like big fruit, big tannins, and big barrel flavors. Chocolate, espresso, tar and bourbon barrel flavors dominate, in keeping with the house style.",Barrister,US,90,28,Syrah
102611,Bougetz 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Lots of muscle in this punchy Sauvignon Blanc, with its ripe lemon, lime, orange and papaya flavors, made bright by crisp acidity. Despite a streak of honey, the finish is dry. Additional richness is provided by barrel fermentation and the addition of a little Sémillon.",Bougetz,US,90,24,Sauvignon Blanc
102612,West Cape Howe 2009 Book Ends Cabernet Sauvignon (Western Australia),"This is a solid value in the world of Cabernet. Textbook notes of cassis and mint lead the way, framed by supple tannins and dressed up with hints of graham crackers and black tea.

102613,William Church 2010 2 Spires Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a blend of 67% Syrah and 33% Cabernet Sauvignon from Red Willow and Dineen, respectively. Though it falls on the lighter side for Washington Syrah, it's proportionate and pleasing, with strawberry fruit, mocha and toast. Tannins are fine and slender; though drinking well now, this could be cellared for awhile longer.",William Church,US,90,34,Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon
102614,Karl Kaspar 2010 Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),"Tantalizing spice notes mix with aromas of quince and lanolin on this fabulous bargain Riesling. While intensely tropical on the palate, it's remarkably nuanced with hints of potpourri, white flowers, and a sharp, steely acidity. Perfect as an aperitif, or paired with spicy, herbaceous Asian cuisine.",Karl Kaspar,Germany,90,13,Riesling
102615,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"With 12% Sémillon in the blend, this is a lovely, fresh, almost exuberant Sauvignon Blanc. Bracing and textural, with good varietal character but no excessive herbaceousness, it's loaded with fruit flavors of melon, grapefruit, kiwi and apple. A fine mix of precision and length.",Chateau Ste. Michelle,US,90,11,Sauvignon Blanc
102616,Michel Torino 2006 Coleccion Chardonnay (Calchaquí Valley),"Aromas of sweet melon and honey suggest an innocuous quality that's confirmed on the palate, where basic apple and pear flavors come across a bit sweet. Finishes with some scour and a little harshness.",Michel Torino,Argentina,83,12,Chardonnay
102617,Pillitteri 2004 Fusion Gewürztraminer-Riesling (Niagara Peninsula),"A slightly earthy, spicy nose leads, followed up by good acidity and a touch of flowers. Pair with a cheese plate or enjoy on its own. Imported by Wine Emporium.",Pillitteri,Canada,83,12,Gewürztraminer-Riesling
102618,Black Swan 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Eastern Australia),"Smooth and medium-bodied, with modest cherry scents and cassis and tobacco flavors. Soft and lacking energy on the finish, but clean.",Black Swan,Australia,83,8,Cabernet Sauvignon
102619,Funky Llama 2007 Tempranillo (Mendoza),"Lightly brambled and ever so slightly green, with pleasant strawberry and raspberry aromas. The mouthfeel is a touch choppy and grabby, but it's not too thin and rough to make it unpleasant. Not bad for the price.",Funky Llama,Argentina,83,6,Tempranillo
102620,Borgo di Colloredo 2005 Gironia Biferno Rosato Red (Molise),"The wine's garnet ruby color is so saturated, it seems more like a light red than a rosato and the aromas recall raspberry, white almond, peppermint and a hint of Sherry.",Borgo di Colloredo,Italy,83,18,Red Blend
102621,Alba 2005 Dry Riesling (New Jersey),"Creamy and fresh on the nose and followed by a play of good acidity and body, this Riesling from New Jersey is both supple and refreshing. The flavors fall a bit flat though—and need more dimension.",Alba,US,83,13,Riesling
102622,Congress Springs 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Harsh and hot, with chili pepper, mint and thinned-down blackberry and cherry flavors.",Congress Springs,US,82,12,Cabernet Sauvignon
102623,Congress Springs 2006 Viognier (Lodi),"You'll find sweet and sour flavors in this wine, like in a LifeSaver lemon candy. The best part is the acidity, which is tart, and keeps the wine balanced.",Congress Springs,US,82,12,Viognier
102624,Jenica Peak 2006 Coastal Series Pinot Grigio (California),"Soft and sweet, with canned apricot and syrupy peach flavors.",Jenica Peak,US,82,10,Pinot Grigio

102626,Pride Mountain 2005 Sangiovese (Sonoma County),"Pride continues to struggle with this variety, as does everyone else in California who tries their hand at it. The '05 is semisweet and simple, with candied cherry-blackberry flavors that finish more like a dessert wine than a dry table wine.",Pride Mountain,US,82,55,Sangiovese
102627,Mazzocco 2005 Stone Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"With 15.5% alcohol, this wine is too hot for balance. It also tastes unnecessarily sweet, with sugared raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors.",Mazzocco,US,82,27,Zinfandel
102628,Congress Springs 2006 Chardonnay (California),"The structure on this wine is just fine, with crisp, coastal acidity and low alcohol making for a clean, well-balanced Chard. Its weakness is in the thinness of flavor. The wine is watery, with mere traces of citrus fruits and peaches.",Congress Springs,US,82,13,Chardonnay
102629,Emerson 2006 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"This is Pinot Gris without any particular varietal character; it could be almost anything. It's got tart, lemon-flavored fruit and a thin, watery finish.",Emerson,US,82,13,Pinot Gris
102630,Four Vines 2005 Maverick Zinfandel (Amador County),"Barbecue is your best bet with this rustic Zin. It's lusty in jammy blackberry, mulberry and vanilla spice flavors that finish with a definite sugariness.",Four Vines,US,82,24,Zinfandel
102631,Four Vines 2005 Old Vine Cuvée Zinfandel (California),"Except for the sweetness, this is a pretty good wine. It has rich tannins, decent acidity, and ripe flavors of blackberry, cherry and raspberry jam. But that white sugary taste is off-putting in a table wine.",Four Vines,US,82,14,Zinfandel
102632,Hesketh 2008 Usual Suspects Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"A drink-now style of warming Shiraz, with plenty of weight and richness, soft tannins and flavors that artfully combine sour plum, cracked pepper, rare beef and chocolate. Drink it over the next few years.",Hesketh,Australia,90,20,Shiraz

102685,Zenato 2007 Sergio Zenato Riserva (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"This muscular Amarone has an almost overripe fragrance, along with chocolate and vanilla notes.

102691,Hall 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"This is a good example of the high-alcohol style of warmth and deliciousness.

This zesty white wine has extra layers of complexity and depth. It's also one of the most versatile food wines around.",J Vineyards & Winery,US,87,18,Pinot Gris
102716,Pradio 1999 Teraje Chardonnay (Friuli Grave),"Despite the modest price, this wine needs some time in the glass or in a decanter to open up. It starts off slowly, then builds pear and quince aromas and flavors through the long, tart, minerally finish. Best Buy.",Pradio,Italy,87,10,Chardonnay
102717,Masi 2002 Colbaraca Classico (Soave),"A Soave that has been partially barrel fermented is unusual, but it works in this wine, which has great concentration, roundness and softness and the complexity of toast.",Masi,Italy,87,11,Garganega
102718,Masottina 2001 Vigneto Ai Palazzi Pinot Grigio (Piave),"This luscious, balanced Pinot Grigio isn't overly complex, but scores for its cactus pear and toasted almond aromas and flavors and its peppery, refreshing finish. It's medium-bodied, with just a hint of unreleased CO2 to enliven it.",Masottina,Italy,87,15,Pinot Grigio
102719,Montes 2001 Alpha Syrah (Curicó Valley),"Solid and sturdy, and more big than small, this Syrah runs toward the red-fruit spectrum. But the nose offers dried fruit, herbs and clove, while there's more clove and fennel underneath the fruit on the palate. There's oak throughout, especially on the finish, but it's not overdone. And if many Syrah-based wines need time to settle, this one seems made for immediate drinking.",Montes,Chile,87,20,Syrah
102720,Concha y Toro 2002 Xplorador Merlot (Rapel Valley),"This Merlot excels beyond its bargain classification by showing purity and a high level of fruit quality. The bouquet exudes plum, chocolate and some creaminess, while the palate bursts with blackberry, bitter chocolate and espresso. Round and satisfying, with enough structure to last a year or two—or until the next vintage comes around.",Concha y Toro,Chile,87,7,Merlot
102721,Dopff & Irion 2014 Cuvée René Dopff Pinot Blanc (Alsace),"Friendly apple fruit sits easily on nose and palate before a refreshing, clean finish. This is an easy, fruit-driven white ideal for a party.",Dopff & Irion,France,86,13,Pinot Blanc
102722,Union de Vignerons de l'Île de Beauté 2015 Rosé (Ile de Beauté),"Made from the local Sciaccarellu grape, this is a delicious, light and perfumed wine. It has tight acidity to go with the red currant flavors and the crisp texture. The wine is poised and refreshing.",Union de Vignerons de l'Île de Beauté,France,86,10,Rosé
102723,Van Ruiten 2015 Chardonnay (Lodi),"Lively aromas like crisp apple and white peach join more creamy, pastry-like flavors of butter, vanilla and toasted almond in this medium-bodied wine. It is soft in texture and so fruity it seems sweet on the finish.",Van Ruiten,US,86,13,Chardonnay
102724,Vignobles Bonhur 2015 Château Terres Douces Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"This wine is tangy and textured with light tannins, a bite of citrus acidity and plenty of fruit. It's bright and has a juicy, lively aftertaste. Drink now.",Vignobles Bonhur,France,86,10,Rosé
102725,Viña Otano 2014 Viura (Rioja),"Largely neutral on the nose, then tangy and still fresh on the palate, this drink-now Viura is clean but unexciting. Flavors of generic citrus finish firm, with a pithy aftertaste.",Viña Otano,Spain,86,12,Viura
102726,MandraRossa 2015 Urra di Mare Sauvignon (Sicilia),"Aromas suggesting honeydew melon, exotic fruit and a hint of tomato leaf lead the nose. The simple palate is a bit less expressive, offering grapefruit and a hint of white peach alongside lively acidity.",MandraRossa,Italy,86,11,Sauvignon
102727,Mastroberardino 2013 Neroametà Aglianico (Campania),"Made with white vinification of Aglianico grapes, this has aromas of dried-up chamomile flower and overripe citrus fruit. The simple palate offers crushed white currant alongside zesty acidity.",Mastroberardino,Italy,86,30,Aglianico
102728,Joseph Filippi 2009 Old Vine Zinfandel (Cucamonga Valley),"In many ways, this is a fascinating sip, but the components are a bit confusing altogether. Aromas of minty berries, tobacco, rustic leather and a very strong camphor scent introduce the nose, and then a lively, quite foamy acidity consumes the palate, where flavors of sweet berries are cut by garden herbs and pepper. It's a little too overpowering.",Joseph Filippi,US,86,29,Zinfandel
102729,Le Petit Cochonnet 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Pays d'Oc),"A pleasant mix of dark berries and fruit lead the bouquet of this friendly wine, with solid notes of black cherry, blackberry and boysenberry throughout. A hint of spice adds interest to the finish, with medium-light tannins and ample acidity resulting in good overall balance.",Le Petit Cochonnet,France,86,10,Cabernet Sauvignon
102730,Leon Beyer 2014 Pinot Blanc (Alsace),"A softly earthy tone is all the nose gives away. The palate is brisk, neutral and has both freshness and a slightly bitter edge. Drink soon.",Leon Beyer,France,86,19,Pinot Blanc
102731,Terredora 2012 Campore (Fiano di Avellino),"Toasted oak, citrus zest and honey aromas lead followed by a balsamic note. The palate offers walnut, oak and the barest hint of butterscotch but it lacks fruit richness.",Terredora,Italy,86,28,Fiano
102732,Tortoise Creek 2014 Jam's Blend Chardonnay (Lodi),"This medium-bodied wine is very fruity in aroma, and exudes ripe pear and fig flavors. Add in creamy vanilla accents and a very soft texture and the effect is almost sweet.",Tortoise Creek,US,86,12,Chardonnay
102733,Undurraga 2014 Gran Reserva Sibaris Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley),"Dusty earth, seashell notes and tomato aromas don't fully announce how snappy, tart and racy this coastal PN is. Almost sour red-plum and pie-cherry flavors finish angular, sharp and zesty to an extreme.",Undurraga,Chile,86,17,Pinot Noir
102734,Vermeil 2013 Frediani Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Calistoga),"This is a juicy and formidably tannic version of the variety, from a famed vineyard known also for Zinfandel. Dry oak and intrusively harsh texture need mellowing before the more gentle notions of dried herb and black cherry can shine.",Vermeil,US,86,70,Cabernet Franc
102735,Viña Maipo 2015 Vitral Chardonnay (Chile),"Apple and citrus aromas are neither well defined nor overly aromatic. Fresh and juicy on the palate, this offers citrus peel and green melon flavors. Mild and short on the finish.",Viña Maipo,Chile,86,11,Chardonnay
102736,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2013 Merlot (California),A soft fruitiness and smooth texture make this medium-bodied red easy to enjoy. Strawberry and cherry notes rest easily on a bed of light tannin that adds an appetizing mouthfeel.,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi,US,86,8,Merlot
102737,Viñedos y Bodegas Pablo 2014 Menguante Garnacha (Cariñena),"Black cherry and plum aromas are solid. This is chunky and heavyset, but comfortable across the palate. Generic plum and berry flavors are pure, while this finishes plump, chunky and with a hint of chocolate.",Viñedos y Bodegas Pablo,Spain,86,14,Garnacha
102738,Concha y Toro 2014 Reserva Casillero del Diablo Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),"Aromas of herbal red fruits, tobacco and vanilla are basic and modest. This has a wiry, acidic mouthfeel and flavors of mixed herbs, tomato, pie cherry, red plum and olive. A fresh, racy finish is tangy and tomatoey.",Concha y Toro,Chile,86,11,Cabernet Sauvignon
102739,Echeverria 2014 Reserva Merlot (Central Valley),"This might be a touch volatile at first, but saucy tomato-like aromas are offset by fresh red-plum notes. A tight and tannic palate softens with time in the glass, while berry flavors carry herb and spice notes onto a lightly herbal finish.",Echeverria,Chile,86,11,Merlot
102740,Famille Hauller 2015 Pinot Blanc (Alsace),"This is a very simple, friendly, fresh and lively white—easy to drink and enjoy with its lemony freshness. It's ideal for a party.",Famille Hauller,France,86,19,Pinot Blanc
102741,Black Stallion 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This aromatic, medium-bodied white flirts with a distinct grassiness that can overwhelm, before settling into finer notions of grapefruit and stone fruit, as well as ripe, fleshy cantaloupe.",Black Stallion,US,86,19,Sauvignon Blanc
102742,Bodega Volcanes de Chile 2013 Tectonia Pinot Noir (Bío Bío Valley),"Chunky aromas of tomato, saucy berry fruits, asphalt and tire rubber are somewhat harsh. Flat and lazy in feel, this chunky, full-bodied number from Bío Bío tastes of baked cherry and plum fruit. A finish with low acidity and not much kick is the ending.",Bodega Volcanes de Chile,Chile,86,23,Pinot Noir
102743,Bota Box 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Lively, spicy oak aromas, rich fruit flavors and a lightly tannic texture make this a well-balanced dry wine that will be great with burgers, ribs or carne asada burritos. The price can't be beat either.",Bota Box,US,86,23,Cabernet Sauvignon
102744,Campellares 2014 Rioja,"Straightforward red-fruit aromas suggest cherry and plum. Rubbery, pinching tannins are the adhesive for this punchy young Rioja that tastes of raspberry and cherry and finishes steady.",Campellares,Spain,86,13,Tempranillo
102745,Château Côte Montpezat 2015 Le Canon de Côte Montpezat Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"Almost white in color, this wine is fruity and crisp with lemon and lime flavors. A light hint of a tannic structure also suggests minerality. The aftertaste is bright and packed with acidity.",Château Côte Montpezat,France,86,20,Rosé
102746,Château Léon 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"This pale-colored wine has a light, perfumed character. A blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, it is an attractive, bone-dry rosé, ripe with strawberry fruits, that will be best with food.",Château Léon,France,86,15,Rosé
102747,Agricola Bellaria 2014 Oltre (Greco di Tufo),"This opens with aromas that recall tropical fruit, hay and a whiff of chopped mint. The palate has weight and an almost oily texture but it lacks fruit richness, suggesting unripe pear, lemon zest and flint alongside brisk acidity.",Agricola Bellaria,Italy,86,30,Greco
102748,Cramele Recas 2014 Legendary Estate Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Romania),"Aromas of black plum, black cherry, green bramble and a touch of eucalyptus precede flavors of blackberry, raspberry and red plum.",Cramele Recas,Romania,86,9,Cabernet Sauvignon
102749,Cramele Recas 2014 Legendary Estate Series Pinot Grigio (Romania),"Pineapple, citrus blossom, and white peach aromas prepare your palate for tastes of green apple, lemon zest and apricots. The finish is crisp and acidic.",Cramele Recas,Romania,86,9,Pinot Grigio
102750,Cramele Recas 2015 Dreambird Merlot (Romania),Aromas of black berry and black cherry lead to flavors of cherry vanilla and red plum before a soft tannic finish.,Cramele Recas,Romania,86,7,Merlot
102751,Nica 2012 Chardonnay (California),Rich flavors like vanilla and fig combine with a creamy texture and sweet finish to make a cream puff of a wine. The texture is soft and acidity quite low.,Nica,US,84,11,Chardonnay
102752,Producta Vignobles 2015 Cabane aux Oiseaux Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"The caramel character of this wine is less attractive than its background of red fruits. The two sides need to come into balance for it to work completely, so wait until late 2016.",Producta Vignobles,France,84,15,Rosé
102753,Rio Madre 2014 Rioja,"Reedy red-fruit aromas lack the clarity that the best wines of this style show. Grabby on the palate, this tastes of basic plum and raspberry. A raw, tannic, rubbery finish is the final act.",Rio Madre,Spain,84,11,Tempranillo
102754,Rios de Chile 2015 Chardonnay (Central Valley),"Bland, fleshy aromas of corn and apple cider are unconvincing but not overtly negative. This feels plump and heavy, like fruit punch. Flavors of cantaloupe and citrus fruits finish yeasty, with notes of corn and white bread.",Rios de Chile,Chile,84,12,Chardonnay
102755,Le Petit Cochonnet 2015 Merlot (Pays d'Oc),"A very drinkable, light and easy to like Merlot, this offers ripe notes of black plum, cherry and berry on the nose and mouth, with a faint hint of milk chocolate in the background. The soft mouthfeel and fruity palate finish short, but clean.",Le Petit Cochonnet,France,84,10,Merlot
102756,Le Petit Cochonnet 2015 Pinot Noir (Pays d'Oc),"A light, easy and cheery selection, with direct aromas and flavors of sweet cherry, red raspberry and strawberry. The mouthfeel is soft and approachable, with virtually no tannins and a clean, short finish. Drink up.",Le Petit Cochonnet,France,84,11,Pinot Noir
102757,Loma Larga 2013 Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),"There are a lot of uncommon, unusual elements to this Pinot. For starters, the nose is volatile, with notes of horseradish and grapefruit. The palate has a solid, juicy feel to it, while mulchy cherry and plum flavors finish aimlessly.",Loma Larga,Chile,84,25,Pinot Noir
102758,Los Portales 2013 Garnacha (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"This wine smells fruity, like raspberry and cranberries, and turns very tart and astringent on the palate. Sharp fruit flavors come out on the finish along with a metallic edge.",Los Portales,US,84,20,Garnacha
102759,Maison Nicolas 2015 Rosé (Gard),"This is herbal and ripely fruited all at once, smelling like sweet pea, carnation and baby powder combined with tones of plum and cherry. The fruity notes continue through to the medium-weight palate, though they're short-lived.",Maison Nicolas,France,84,9,Rosé
102760,Montebuena 2014 Cuvée KPF (Rioja),"This light-bodied Rioja smells of cherry, plum and cotton candy. It's a bit thin on the palate but offers just enough body to be worthwhile. Mild plum and cherry flavors hollow out on the simple finish.",Montebuena,Spain,84,13,Tempranillo Blend
102761,Montes 2014 Classic Series Merlot (Colchagua Costa),"Forced, candied aromas of chocolaty oak and herbal, slightly weedy berry fruits feed into a chunky, blocky, creamy palate with saucy berry flavors combined with minty, top-heavy oak. The finish tastes minty, lactic and oaky, with heat.",Montes,Chile,84,13,Merlot
102762,Rayun 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),"Berry and cherry aromas register as soupy and flat. Like the nose, this feels flat, chewy and dense. Stewed, rubbery prunes and plums finish with a fig-like note and rubbery tannins.",Rayun,Chile,84,8,Cabernet Sauvignon
102763,Rios de Chile 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"Flat, dusty aromas of lees and vanilla cookies are rather lifeless. While this is wet and somewhat juicy in feel, it's bland as a whole, with yeasty melon and citrus flavors that finish bready.",Rios de Chile,Chile,84,12,Sauvignon Blanc
102764,River Road 2015 Un-Oaked Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"Fermented entirely in stainless steel, this is a simple, tropically sweet wine, characterized by mango, pineapple and juicy melon.",River Road,US,84,13,Chardonnay
102765,"Greenwood Ridge 2013 Hundred Point, Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)","This medium-bodied wine has an earthy aroma, muted cherry flavors and a smooth enough texture. It is good and drinkable.",Greenwood Ridge,US,84,50,Pinot Noir
102766,Housley's Century Oak 2013 Judy's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"This full-bodied wine has earthy, woodsy aromas, ripe and mature fruit flavors and a broad, almost soft texture. It's very mouth-filling and smooth, and will please people who like a little rusticity in their wines.",Housley's Century Oak,US,84,29,Cabernet Sauvignon
102767,Twisted 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Aromas like jam and maple syrup and equally ripe, generous flavors give this medium-bodied wine an easy appeal. The texture is soft for this type, the flavors are not too deep and the finish is light.",Twisted,US,84,8,Cabernet Sauvignon
102768,Valtravieso 2011 Vendimia Seleccionada (Ribera del Duero),"Saucy aromas run low on fruit and high on tomato and green herbs. In the mouth, this feels rough. Flavors of bell pepper, pizza sauce and oregano finish without the ripeness that should be present in a high-end 2011 RDD.",Valtravieso,Spain,84,52,Red Blend
102769,Château Lamothe-Vincent 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"This is a strawberry-pink-colored wine with candied flavors balanced by acidity. It is fruity, crisp and light in character.",Château Lamothe-Vincent,France,84,11,Rosé
102770,Château Laubès 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"With only the lightest texture, this wine almost tastes like a white wine. It has plenty of citrus character, partnered with apple and green-fruit flavors. At the end, look out for the bite of tannin that gives it a more rosé character.",Château Laubès,France,84,13,Rosé
102771,Four Sisters Ranch 2011 Serena's Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Rather vegetal aromas of jalapeño and bell pepper mix with red fruit on the nose of this bottling. Those same bell peppery notes carry through the palate, which is intriguing but will likely confuse many drinkers.",Four Sisters Ranch,US,84,26,Cabernet Sauvignon
102772,Frei Brothers 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),This is a simple representation of the variety: medium in acidity and weight and a roundness of appropriate apple and pear that finishes flat.,Frei Brothers,US,84,20,Chardonnay
102773,G7 2013 The 7th Generation Reserva Carmenère (Loncomilla Valley),"Woody, creamy aromas of black fruits precede a sketchy palate with acidity akin to vinegar. Medicinal flavors of oak, mint and generic berry fruits finish with a pasty feel and herbal, oaky flavors.",G7,Chile,84,15,Carmenère
102774,Albamar 2015 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Prickly, punchy, pryazinic aromas will have you thinking this is Sauvignon Blanc or Spanish Verdejo. A sharp palate is more about acid than body, while this continues with its SB-like character via green flavors of lime and arugula. A crisp finish evaporates into nothing.",Albamar,Chile,83,12,Chardonnay
102775,Indomita 2015 Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Heavy oak and marginal white-fruit scents make for a compromised nose. This feels chunky and resiny, with heavy flavors of clove and raw wood. Additional clove notes on the finish render this Chardonnay an underachiever.",Indomita,Chile,83,15,Chardonnay
102776,Loft 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Dark-colored, full-bodied and practically sweet with oak, this box wine spreads spicy flavors around the fruit, and becomes more syrupy with each sip.",Loft,US,83,25,Cabernet Sauvignon
102777,Loft 2014 Chardonnay (Monterey),"Apple and honeydew aromas show on the nose of this boxed wine, which prides itself on having a small eco-footprint. The palate is flatter than the nose, with green apple skin flavors but not much texture or acidity to speak of.",Loft,US,83,25,Chardonnay
102778,Santa Alicia 2015 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Maipo Valley),"Underripe aromas of bell pepper and scallion correctly announce a shearing, high-acid palate. Salty, tart flavors of citrus fruits finish with pyrazine-driven green notes.",Santa Alicia,Chile,83,10,Sauvignon Blanc
102779,Jekel 2014 Pinot Noir (Monterey),"Barely noticeable aromas of wet rocks and sour red-fruit skins try to show on the nose of this wine. The palate is characterized by iron, wet rocks and dust flavors, without much fruit.",Jekel,US,83,19,Pinot Noir
102780,Kunza 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley),"Rustic, gaseous aromas of soupy berry fruits and tire rubber create a struggling nose. Rubbery tannins and a lack of a focal point make for a jumbled palate, while this tastes stewy, weedy and low on fresh fruit.",Kunza,Chile,83,16,Cabernet Sauvignon
102781,Herdade dos Machados 2009 Morgado da Canita Red (Alentejano),"This feels very ripe, perhaps overripe, with its seemingly sweet flavor of black fruit juice and its soft structure. It's appealing and does have some tannins, but it is not for aging.",Herdade dos Machados,Portugal,84,5,Portuguese Red
102782,Pazzo 2009 Red (Napa Valley),"From Bacio Divino, this Sangiovese-based blend is curiously soft. While it has forward cherry, cocoa and spice flavors, it simply lacks structural integrity.The alcohol is evident on the warm, dry finish.",Pazzo,US,84,32,Red Blend
102783,Quinta de Gomariz 2011 Espadeiro Rosé (Vinho Verde),This is a fresh and fragrant rosé from the Vinho Verde region. It has light acidity and a red fruit flavor. The lightest prickle gives just that extra lift.,Quinta de Gomariz,Portugal,84,13,Rosé
102784,Sean Minor 2010 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Simple and agreeable, this can be paired with a burger or beef taco. It's dry and clean, with pleasant cherry and cola flavors.",Sean Minor,US,84,22,Pinot Noir
102785,Kirkland Signature 2009 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Simple, dry and one dimensional, this has cola and cherry jam flavors, and a silky, delicate texture.",Kirkland Signature,US,84,10,Pinot Noir
102786,Lost Angel 2009 Ruckus White (California),"Made from a bunch of different varieties, including Viognier and Pinot Grigio, this white blend is off-dry, with a sweet edge to the orange and peach fruit.",Lost Angel,US,84,10,White Blend
102787,Matchbook 2010 Old Head Chardonnay (Dunnigan Hills),This crisp Chardonnay has a disjointedness about it. Its aroma and flavor is most akin to Lemonheads candy.,Matchbook,US,84,15,Chardonnay
102788,Monte Seis Reis 2010 Boa Memória Branco White (Alentejano),"Soft, round and gentle, this has a creamed apple flavor. It has a full, ripe character, with just an edge of green herb and spice.",Monte Seis Reis,Portugal,84,,Portuguese White
102789,Aveleda 2011 Casal Garcia Tinto Red (Portuguese Table Wine),"Light and stalky, this has black currant fruit and considerable acidity. With its soft tannins and fruity character, it is ready to drink now.",Aveleda,Portugal,84,,Portuguese Red
102790,Barton & Guestier 2011 Bistro Pinot Noir (Ile de Beauté),"Soft and fruity with some sweetness, this red-fruit-flavored wine is rounded and warm, crispened by acidity.",Barton & Guestier,France,84,8,Pinot Noir
102791,Black Box 2010 Sweet Red (California),"Black Box hops onto the popular sweet red wine train with this blend. It is, as advertised, sweet, but not too much, giving a sugary edge to the blackberries and cherries.",Black Box,US,84,25,Red Blend
102792,Black Box 2011 Chardonnay (California),"A good Chardonnay to serve at parties, this shows plenty of oak-driven vanilla and toast flavors that ride high over the seemingly sweet note of pineapple candy. It will satisfy lots of Chardophiles, at an affordable price.",Black Box,US,84,25,Chardonnay
102793,Caves Aliança 2009 Vista Tinta Roriz (Beiras),"Lightweight, with smooth red fruit and acidity, this is soft and round. The berry fruit neatly merges with the gentle tannins.",Caves Aliança,Portugal,84,,Tinta Roriz
102794,Twisted Sisters 2009 Matriarch Red (Paso Robles),"Made in an old-fashioned Paso Robles style, this is pretty sweet, soft and simple. There's not much complexity, but it has plenty of ripe blackberry, cherry and spice flavors.",Twisted Sisters,US,84,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
102795,Twisted Sisters 2010 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"This is for you, if you like your Zins in a sweet, soft style. It tastes like the filling from a black­berry and cherry pie, dusted with exotic spices, like cinnamon and black pepper.",Twisted Sisters,US,84,20,Zinfandel
102796,Valentin Bianchi 2011 Elsa Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Apple and white fruit aromas set up a balanced, reasonably full palate, with banana, creamy oak, vanilla and apple flavors. It feels solid and round, with a clean finish.",Valentin Bianchi,Argentina,84,10,Chardonnay
102797,Vignobles Garrigae 2010 Seigneurie de Peyrat Tradition Chardonnay-Viognier (Pays d'Oc),"Vanilla and toasted almond aromas evolve into a scent of tarte tatin. Full bodied, with warm alcohol, this shows medium fruit concentration. The acidity is borderline in its balance, leaning to flabiness. The tactile heat on the medium finish is distracting.",Vignobles Garrigae,France,84,,Chardonnay-Viognier
102798,Walt 2010 Hein Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"The first noticeable aspect is that it seems to have no structure. The cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors have been elaborately oaked, but there's nothing for the mouth to grip onto.",Walt,US,84,60,Pinot Noir
102799,Plungerhead 2010 Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),The mouthfeel has sandpapery tannins and some green peppercorn notes alongside riper flavors of blackberries and sweet currants. It's a rustic Zin to drink with barbecue.,Plungerhead,US,84,20,Zinfandel
102800,Quinta do Portal 2011 Trevo White (Vinho Verde),"This is a lively, off-dry wine with intense acidity to accompany its crisp apple and citrus flavors. Very fruity, it's ready to drink now. Screwcap.",Quinta do Portal,Portugal,84,9,Portuguese White
102801,Rare NV 4 Grape Blend Red (California),"Here's a good, robust red wine. It's made in a country-style, with tobacco, cherry and spice flavors and a jagged mouthfeel. Drink it with tacos and burgers.",Rare,US,84,10,Red Blend
102802,Stephen Ross 2010 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"Dry and acidic, this has flavors of green mint and sour cherry candy. Not likely to improve with age, but give it an hour in the decanter to let it soften.",Stephen Ross,US,84,24,Pinot Noir
102803,L. Tramier & Fils 2010 Bourricot Pinot Noir (Vin de France),"This is a soft, gentle Pinot with a plum jelly flavor derived from a touch of sweetness in its fruit. Drink now.",L. Tramier & Fils,France,84,12,Pinot Noir
102804,LoveThisLife 2009 White (California),"Made to appeal to the modern taste for sweetness, this blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Viognier is simple in jammy apricot, citrus and tropical fruit flavors. It has bright acidity, which helps balance it.",LoveThisLife,US,84,13,White Blend

102806,Atwater NV Bubble Pinot Noir Rosé Sparkling (Seneca Lake),"Ebullient blossom and berry notes waft from this unique carbonated Pinot Noir (blended with proportions of Cabernet Franc and Cayuga grapes). Plump strawberry and cherry flavors are dry on the palate, but concentrated, accented by brisk acidity and sharp, piercing bubbles.",Atwater,US,87,16,Sparkling Blend
102807,Bodegas Ribón 2012 Tinto Ribón Crianza (Ribera del Duero),"Aromas of iodine, horse hide and saucy berry fruits are intriguing on the nose. The palate is tannic and mildly astringent offering rustic notes of baked, leathery black-fruit flavors. The finish is hot and jammy, with a leathery kick.",Bodegas Ribón,Spain,87,32,Tempranillo
102808,Boudreaux Cellars 2011 Wallula Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"This unusual wine offers aromas of nori, dried flowers, bittersweet chocolate and cherry cola. It's full flavored with a lightly tacky feel.",Boudreaux Cellars,US,87,60,Syrah
102809,Kirkland Signature 2013 Signature Series Merlot (Oakville),"Cherry, raspberry and vanilla combine for an inviting mix of ripeness and sweet bouquet. A fruity component also sits nicely atop this structured wine marked by soft, fine tannins. The finish is robust in black pepper and clove.",Kirkland Signature,US,87,15,Merlot

102896,Manuel Olivier 2012 Vieilles Vignes (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits),"In this case, Vieilles Vignes (old vines) only means vines over 20 years. The wine is soft, rounded and full of red cherry fruitiness. Judicious wood aging has rounded the wine out while leaving all its fruit intact. It can be drunk now, but will be better from 2016.",Manuel Olivier,France,86,30,Pinot Noir
102897,Windy Bay 2012 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Aromatically appealing, it features notes of allspice, herbs, cola and cherry. The palate is lighter in style with a scrape-y feel, not fully delivering on all that the aromas have to offer.",Windy Bay,US,86,15,Pinot Noir
102898,Vignerons de Buxy 2012 Buissonnier (Mercurey),"This light-colored wine has a spicy character that points up the tannins as well as the red berry fruits. It has a light feeling, with refreshing acidity that shows strongly at the end. It's ready to drink.",Vignerons de Buxy,France,86,26,Pinot Noir
102899,Villa Girardi 2010 Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"Aromas of tobacco leaf, wet soil, mature plum, resin and a whiff of barnyard lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The palate offers dried prune layered with notes of chocolate and grilled sage. The fleeting finish closes on a rather bitter note.",Villa Girardi,Italy,86,65,Red Blend
102900,Wines & Winemakers 2013 Lua Cheia em Vinhas Velhas Album Antão Vaz (Alentejano),"Yellow fruits and apple juice combine in this fresh, mineral-driven wine. It's tangy, tight with acidity while allowing room for pineapple and tropical flavors at the end. It's ready to drink but will be better in 2016.",Wines & Winemakers,Portugal,86,12,Antão Vaz
102901,Clos La Chance 2010 Amber's Cuvee Sparkling (Santa Cruz Mountains),"A faint hint of pink shines on this sparkler named after the winery owners' dog. Aromas of fresh melon and slight peach lead to a faint cherry note upon sipping and creamy mouthfeel, followed by plum skin tartness and a yeasty, sour bitterness.",Clos La Chance,US,86,40,Sparkling Blend
102902,Pagos del Rey 2008 Arnegui Reserva (Rioja),"Wiry cherry aromas are a touch cheesy and also medicinal. This is pinched and astringent, with a choppy mix of buttery red-berry flavors and vanilla. Like most 2008s, this finishes hard and abrupt, with staunch tannins.",Pagos del Rey,Spain,86,20,Tempranillo
102903,Quinta de Covela 2013 Covela Rosé (Minho),"Made principally from Touriga Nacional, this is a rich wine with attractive acidity and strawberry fruitiness. It is ripe, touched with caramel and finished with wild raspberry flavors.",Quinta de Covela,Portugal,86,16,Rosé
102904,Ricci Curbastro 2009 Extra Brut Sparkling (Franciacorta),"Subdued aromas recall white flower and stone fruit. The muted palate reveals mature yellow apple skin, lemon zest and notes of nut butter alongside sharp bubbles. It has a tangy but fleeting finish.",Ricci Curbastro,Italy,86,47,Sparkling Blend
102905,Ruhlmann NV Signature Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"This is fresh, not quite dry and a fine apéritif wine. With its soft texture, apple fruits and light mousse, it's both fruity and crisp, with a rounded, fragrant aftertaste.",Ruhlmann,France,86,15,Sparkling Blend
102906,Dopff & Irion NV Brut Rosé Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"Crisp and textured, this offers plenty of fresh apple and red fruit flavors. It's a light, bright wine that's poised and stylish, in a fine apéritif style.",Dopff & Irion,France,86,18,Sparkling Blend
102907,Foris 2012 Maple Ranch Estate Pinot Noir (Rogue Valley),"Vibrantly fruity, it offers aromas of currant, raspberry, celery stalk and spice. The palate has tart cranberry flavors, finishing a bit short.",Foris,US,86,35,Pinot Noir
102908,Vega Sindoa 2012 El Chaparral Old Vines Garnacha (Navarra),"This Garnacha is heavily oaked.Smoky, woody aromas come with dusty berry notes, while the palate is heavy, with cheek-smacking tannins. Flavors of hickory and roasted blackberry finish with another creamy, woody dose of oak.",Vega Sindoa,Spain,86,15,Garnacha
102909,Il Mosnel 2010 Brut Satèn Chardonnay (Franciacorta),"This toasty bottling shows some evident maturity in terms of fruit richness. It offers toasted walnut, espresso, vanilla and yellow apple-skin flavors alongside large, brisk bubbles and crisp acidity.",Il Mosnel,Italy,86,41,Chardonnay
102910,Jaffelin 2013 Les Villages de Jaffelin (Mâcon-Péronne),"One of the lesser-known of the many Mâcon appellations, Péronne is close to Clessé. The wine is smooth, ripe and fruity, with a creamed pear and lightly lemon flavor. With a hint of minerality, it could age until 2016.",Jaffelin,France,86,20,Chardonnay
102911,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2012 Clos des Rois Premier Cru (Maranges),"From the recent appellation at the southern end of the Côte de Beaune, this is a light and very fruity wine with little discernible tannin or structure. Red cherries and fresh acidity dominate and the wine should be drunk young.",Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter,France,86,,Pinot Noir
102912,Lealtanza 2011 Crianza (Rioja),"This starts out savory and smoky on the nose, but with airing it turns murky. The palate is tight in structure, with red-fruit acidity. Flavors of cherry, raspberry and oaky vanilla turn roasted and stalky as this unwinds on a fresh-feeling finish.",Lealtanza,Spain,86,30,Tempranillo
102913,Maximin Grünhäuser 2012 Herrenberg Alte Reben Trocken Riesling (Mosel),"Dust and pollen notes linger from nose to finish on this dry, full-bodied Riesling. Apple and pear flavors are a tad savory, but brightened by crisp lemon acidity. A refreshing and easy drinking wine.",Maximin Grünhäuser,Germany,86,42,Riesling
102914,Aldonia 2012 Vendimia (Rioja),"Dusty, medicinal berry and plum aromas are open and bright. A juicy but pinched palate features narrow flavors of plum and berry skins, while the finish is rubbery in feel, with astringency as well as bright residual fruit flavors.",Aldonia,Spain,86,15,Tempranillo Blend
102915,Altemasi 2010 Brut Chardonnay (Trento),"Aromas of peach blossom, citrus and a yeasty note of fresh biscuits lead the nose on this 100% Chardonnay. The palate offers walnut husk, lemon zest and a confectionary note alongside sharp acidity.",Altemasi,Italy,86,30,Chardonnay
102916,Ancient Oak Cellars 2011 Siebert Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Soft and supple, this has a heavy streak of spearmint and an herbal finish that also offers dark black cherry and ripe, leathery tannins.",Ancient Oak Cellars,US,86,40,Pinot Noir
102917,Cellers Baronia del Montsant 2010 Englora Red (Montsant),"Reduced, stewy, lightly herbal aromas blend berry and tomato scents. The acidity on this five-grape blend is pointed and overriding. Flavors of herbal berry and currant are tangy but also stewy, while the finish is long and green in flavor.",Cellers Baronia del Montsant,Spain,86,21,Red Blend
102918,Benziger 2012 Appellation Series Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a fairly light, bright Pinot Noir with the marks of a ripe year and time spent in oak. It is crafted under the guidelines of a certified sustainable grape growing program. Medium-bodied and juicy, it's fairly priced and ready to enjoy now.",Benziger,US,86,29,Pinot Noir
102919,Herdade do Rocim 2013 Olho de Mocho Rosé (Alentejano),"Soft and ripe, this has strawberry fruit flavors, a soft texture and a warm, rich feel. There is just enough acidity to balance this really food-friendly rosé.",Herdade do Rocim,Portugal,86,30,Rosé
102920,Le Bertarole 2010 Podere Cariano (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"Rustic aromas recall wet earth, barnyard and leather with a whiff of ripe, black fruit. The thick palate is rather muddled and delivers both sweet and bitter sensations of prune, overripe black plum, confectionary flavors, vanilla and notes of resin alongside astringent tannins that dry out the mouth.",Le Bertarole,Italy,86,35,Red Blend
102921,Poças NV Poças Pink (Port),"The pink hue is a little flat. That also applies to the palate, with the fruit showing some maturity and hinting at wood aging. It's a rounded style, full in the mouth, with ripe caramel flavors at the end. Drink now.",Poças,Portugal,86,15,Port
102922,Quintas de Melgaço 2013 QM Blue White (Vinho Verde),"Light and bright, this has a crisp prickle on the tongue, along with canned grapefruit and tight apple-skin flavors. It is almost dry, which gives the wine a mineral texture that adds a bite. Drink now.",Quintas de Melgaço,Portugal,86,9,Portuguese White
102923,Augusta Winery 2008 Seyval Blanc (Augusta),"A pretty, grapey wine with tones of pine and lemon underlying flavors of green plum and quince. It's flavorful, off-dry and refreshing; a good expression of Seyval Blanc.",Augusta Winery,US,84,9,Seyval Blanc
102924,Bella 2007 Lily Hill Estate Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"A little too dry and tannic, with earthy flavors of tobacco, sage, pepper and dried leather, which only partially relieve the modest blackberries and black currants. Way too astringent all the way through.",Bella,US,84,40,Syrah
102925,Carmen 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),"Dusty apple aromas are less citrusy than ideal, and the palate is cidery and tangy. Finishes with heft, length and weight, which all seems a little overbearing given the wine's simplicity. Just good enough but doesn't fully click.",Carmen,Chile,84,10,Sauvignon Blanc
102926,Pulenta Estate 2008 La Flor Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Foxy and jumpy smelling at first, with brambly raspberry aromas. The palate feels heavy and baked, with grabby tannins in support of herbal, mildly weedy berry fruit flavors. Finishes saucy, with a hint of tomato. Not pure and focused like the La Flor Malbec.",Pulenta Estate,Argentina,84,16,Cabernet Sauvignon
102927,Simonnet-Febvre 2007 Sauvignon de Saint-Bris (Saint-Bris),"In a piece of French wine shorthand, the new appellation of Saint-Bris takes in the old Sauvignon de Saint-Bris wines. The style, though, hasn't changed: an attractive, if rustic type, with crisp gooseberry and grapefruit flavors and a fresh burst of acidity. Screwcap.",Simonnet-Febvre,France,84,13,Sauvignon Blanc
102928,Williamson Wines 2006 Clarissa Vin Rouge Red (Dry Creek Valley),"Dry and rough in texture, with berry, cherry, tobacco, herb and spice flavors wrapped into edgy, slightly green tannins. Turns sharp on the finish, and not likely to age.",Williamson Wines,US,84,47,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
102929,Mendocino Farms 2005 Heart Arrow Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino),"Dry, with thick tannins housing blackberry, herb and olive flavors. Drink now.",Mendocino Farms,US,84,24,Cabernet Sauvignon
102930,Messina Hof 2009 Muscat Canelli (Texas),"Charming and perfumed, with notes of musk, white flowers and wild grapes on the nose and exotic spices in the mouth. This is not a concentrated wine, but there's enough acidity here to balance the slight sweetness and to make it a refreshing apéritif. Drink up.",Messina Hof,US,84,8,Muscat Canelli
102931,Morandé 2008 Pionero Merlot (Rapel Valley),"Berry, pickle and bramble aromas are a little tough and crusted over, while the palate is snappy and fresh in feel, with flavors of herbal berry fruit and pepper. A mild hint of oak and resin dry up the finish.",Morandé,Chile,84,9,Merlot
102932,La Chiripada 2007 Artist Series 1 Dolcetto (New Mexico),"The nose is honest and bright but not terribly expressive, with just a few delicate raspberry and cherry tones. In the mouth, bing cherry and damp earth notes takes over and continue on the medium finish. Try with a veal chop. Drink up.",La Chiripada,US,84,35,Dolcetto
102933,Howling Moon 2008 Chardonnay (Lodi),"A good, dry Chardonnay that gets the job done at a fair price. Shows peaches and cream flavors with a bit of sharpness and green herbs on the finish.",Howling Moon,US,84,12,Chardonnay
102934,La Storia 2006 Cuvee 32 Red (Alexander Valley),"A raw, rustic blend based on Sangiovese and Merlot, this wine is very dry and astringent in tannins. It's an old-fashioned wine that's technically without flaws.",La Storia,US,84,25,Red Blend
102935,Luigi Bosca 2009 Finca la Linda Chardonnay (Luján de Cuyo),"Basic apricot and peach aromas lead to melon, banana and pithy flavors. The palate is a little thick and mealy, while the finish has pretty good feel and length, but not much flavor. Slightly tropical and simple.",Luigi Bosca,Argentina,84,11,Chardonnay
102936,O. Fournier 2007 Urban Uco Tempranillo (Uco Valley),"Sharp, minty aromas mixed with stemmy red fruit set up a modest, middleweight palate of semisweet, generic red fruit flavors. Quick on the finish, with a spot of green flavor. Good enough but lacks the concentration and deeper aromas and flavors of Urban Malbec.",O. Fournier,Argentina,84,11,Tempranillo
102937,Pahrump Valley Winery 2005 Nevada Ridge First Crush Zinfandel (Nevada),"A luxurious mouthfeel and good concentration are this wine's chief attractions. Flavors are more earthy than fruity, with tones of compost and stewed prunes. Medium finish shows ripe but slightly drying tannins. Drink now.",Pahrump Valley Winery,US,84,75,Zinfandel
102938,Sobon Estate 2008 Viognier (Amador County),"Slightly sweet, with a honeyed edge to the rich pear, apple, peach and tropical fruit flavors. Just-in-time acidity fortunately provides balance.",Sobon Estate,US,84,16,Viognier
102939,Terre Rouge 2007 Tete-a-Tete Red (Sierra Foothills),"Despite some black cherry richness, there's a green, minty, stalky note of unripeness in this blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre that limits its appeal. Decanting doesn't help and neither will aging.",Terre Rouge,US,84,18,Rhône-style Red Blend
102940,Three Fox 2007 Il Volpe Sangiovese (Virginia),"There is potential in this wine that bodes well for the future of Sangiovese in Virginia. The nose is charming, with mocha, fall leaves and cherries that slide into a silky palate with woodsy touches. Juicy, raspberry-inflected finish. Try with steak. Drink now.",Three Fox,US,84,23,Sangiovese
102941,Castello di Borghese 2006 Founder's Field Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (North Fork of Long Island),"Clove and vanilla make for a serious, if not terribly refreshing, opening. There's nice grapefruit and pomelo fruit here and a medium, lemony finish that veers towards tart. Drink up.",Castello di Borghese,US,84,26,Sauvignon Blanc
102942,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2006 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a simple, light take on Syrah, with a little bit of black pepper, a hint of underbrush, but none of the texture and detail of pricier Washington bottles. It's a light, pleasant red, fine for pizza night.",Chateau Ste. Michelle,US,84,13,Syrah
102943,Doña Paula 2009 Los Cardos Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza),"Aromas of white grapefruit, celery and other prickly fruits lose steam with airing, while the green apple and lime flavors are solid and offer some sweetness. Wet in the mouth, which is what you want, but standard fare as a whole.",Doña Paula,Argentina,84,10,Sauvignon Blanc
102944,Easton 2007 Cooper Ranch Barbera (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Acidity dominates this wine, giving it a tart, almost sour taste. Couple that with the sizable tannins, and you have an uncomfortable wine. Call it rustic, old world. The blackberry, currant, coffee and herb flavors are fine.",Easton,US,84,22,Barbera
102945,Gilbert Cellars 2007 Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope),"Even grapier than the Cabernet Sauvignon, this forward, light, candied, confected wine has a hole in the middle. The tannins turn quite astringent, a marked contrast to the sweetness of the fruit.",Gilbert Cellars,US,84,32,Cabernet Franc
102946,Glenora 2007 Mason Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),"Readily likeable, with a nose of summer fruit soup layered over notes of field greens. The texture is lazy, with moderate acidity and almost no tannin. Try with ribs in a sweet barbecue sauce. Drink now.",Glenora,US,84,18,Cabernet Sauvignon
102947,Glenora 2008 Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Confected but pleasant aromas of cotton candy and sour apple drops dominate the nose, while the palate unfolds nicely with layers of lemon and red apple. Soft and lush, it picks up an apricot accent on the medium finish. Try with Thai food. Drink now.",Glenora,US,84,16,Riesling
102948,Finca Sophenia 2009 Altosur Sauvignon Blanc (Tupungato),"Lime and green melon aromas are a bit less than clean and pure, and the palate serves up a pile of jalapeño and bell pepper, with some lime in the background. Short on the finish, and kind of dilute.",Finca Sophenia,Argentina,83,11,Sauvignon Blanc
102949,Gilbert Cellars 2007 Estate Malbec (Wahluke Slope),"This vineyard has proven it can ripen good Malbec, but here it seems as if something has gone sideways. There is a gluey scent underneath the blackberry fruit, and the wine seems chalky and disjointed in the mouth, with more of the band-aid flavors in the finish.",Gilbert Cellars,US,83,26,Malbec
102950,Woolundry Rd 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia),"This wine is a bit hard and ungenerous but certainly not lacking in concentration or intensity. Cassis and cedar scents give way to dark, chocolaty flavors. There's not a lot of bright fruit or nuance, but it will ably partner simple grilled meats.",Woolundry Rd,Australia,86,14,Cabernet Sauvignon
102951,Anam Cara 2005 Nicholas Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is a pretty wine, and the initial flavors are soft and mature, suggesting a wine that's ready to drink now. In the mouth it falls away quickly with a slightly oxidized character that suggests an early fade is on the way. It's gentle and drinks well enough right now, with some barrel notes of caramel and coffee beefing up the finish.",Anam Cara,US,86,30,Pinot Noir
102952,Archery Summit 2004 Premier Cuvée Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"An exotic bouquet suggests dried roses, brown sugar, cranberry and plum jam. There's a sweetness in the mouth that continues the impression of brown sugar, or maybe a streak of cola. It's an interesting bottle that could develop further or fall off a cliff; it turns a little funky in the finish. More than 12,000 cases were made.",Archery Summit,US,86,37,Pinot Noir
102953,Cartlidge & Browne 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"A solid entry into the everyday Cabernet sweepstakes. Shows ripe, juicy blackberry, cassis and spice flavors in a smooth, polished texture whose tannins cry out for steaks and chops.",Cartlidge & Browne,US,86,12,Cabernet Sauvignon
102954,Ceravolo 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Adelaide Plains),"Features pleasant but slightly simple flavors of candied cherries and cedar, with a smooth mouthfeel and just a hint of tannin on the finish. Drink now. Imported by Walca International.",Ceravolo,Australia,86,19,Cabernet Sauvignon
102955,Doña Paula 2006 Los Cardos Syrah (Luján de Cuyo),"Mildly smoky and toasty aromas lead to a lightly oaked palate that's largely defined by black cherry and some rich berry syrup. It's a full, colorful Syrah with a chunky mouthfeel and a satisfying but short finish. Drink now.",Doña Paula,Argentina,86,10,Syrah
102956,Kenwood 2004 Reserve Merlot (Sonoma County),"Tasted in October, this still-young Merlot is tannic and jammy. It shows fresh primary fruit flavors of raspberries, cherries and blackberries that are a bit one-dimensional. Give it until mid-2008 to develop some bottle complexity.",Kenwood,US,86,25,Merlot
102957,Leeuwin Estate 2003 Prelude Vineyards Cabernet Merlot (Margaret River),"There's a tobacco and tomato leaf character that gives this an almost floral aroma, but also simpler cassis and cherry fruit. Some herbal notes persist on the palate, but this medium-bodied wine avoids the vegetal side of things, finishing fresh and clean.",Leeuwin Estate,Australia,86,29,Cabernet Merlot
102958,Parkers Estate 2005 Riverside Crossing Syrah (Sonoma County),"Nice and drily balanced, this is pretty tannic, with blackberry, cherry, leather, carob, coffee and peppery spice flavors that finish with an intriguing touch of tangerine rind. Drink now.",Parkers Estate,US,86,13,Syrah
102959,Pearson Vineyards 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley),"This is a perfectly fine example of Clare Valley Cabernet, one that emphasizes refinement and elegance over sheer power and intensity. Cassis, tobacco and a hint of vanilla account for the bulk of the aromatic and flavor interest, and it turns mouthwatering on the finish. Should hold well through 2015.",Pearson Vineyards,Australia,86,37,Cabernet Sauvignon
102960,Simonnet-Febvre 2006 Chablis,"A ripe, crisp, very fresh Chablis bursting with green fruits, with a light layer of caramel and green herbs. Delicious now.",Simonnet-Febvre,France,86,22,Chardonnay
102961,Campos Góticos 2003 Crianza (Ribera del Duero),"In accordance to what 2003 dealt out, this wine is a bit stewy and broad. It shows cola, tree bark and baked fruit on the nose, and then sweet plum and chocolate on the finish. It's not a wine for deep contemplation; drink now to enjoy its robust plumpness.",Campos Góticos,Spain,86,25,Tempranillo
102962,Frostwatch 2005 Chardonnay (Bennett Valley),"Lots to like in this dry, fruity Chardonnay. It has flavors of tropical fruits, buttered toast and caramel, wrapped into a rich, creamy mouthfeel. But it's pretty acidic, if you're sensitive to prickliness in your wines.",Frostwatch,US,86,29,Chardonnay
102963,Vinos Sanz 2006 Montesol Verdejo (Rueda),"Slightly warmer in style, with caramel and vanilla aromas, yet the palate runs more toward freshness, with orange and pineapple standing out. With its good acidity and zest, this wine won't ever be called flabby. Drink now for solid results.",Vinos Sanz,Spain,86,15,Verdejo
102964,Abbazia Santa Anastasia 2006 Sinestesìa White (Sicilia),"This is a blend of Inzolia and Sauvignon from a producer located high up the steep mountains above Cefalù on Sicily's western flank with cool nighttime temperature and soothing breezes. Straightforward aromas include green herb, white stone and citrus.",Abbazia Santa Anastasia,Italy,86,29,White Blend
102965,Pascual Toso 2007 Maipu Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza),"Better than most Argentinean Sauvignon Blancs, and made in a fuller-bodied style. The nose has weight and wax aromas, as well as melon, and the palate features ripe, almost pithy citrus. Dried apricot and a nick of passion fruit work the finish. Drink immediately.",Pascual Toso,Argentina,85,12,Sauvignon Blanc
102966,Red Mud 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia),"Shows some slightly green tomato-leaf and bell-pepper notes as well as hints of leather and hung game, but despite all that, there's also ripe cassis and chocolate flavors and a supple mouthfeel. Imported by MHW,Ltd.",Red Mud,Australia,85,16,Cabernet Sauvignon
102967,Abbazia Santa Anastasia 2006 Baccante White (Sicilia),"From one of Sicily's most beautiful and promising vineyards, Baccante is a blend of Grillo and Chardonnay with bright clean acidity and fragrant yellow fruit. The only setback here is a matchstick aroma (not present in past years) that prevents this vintage from scoring higher.",Abbazia Santa Anastasia,Italy,85,42,White Blend
102968,Archery Summit 2004 Renegade Ridge Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"A light entry holds flavors of strawberry and tomato leaf, then turns tannic. Chewy and earthy, with more than a hint of seed and stem, this wine comes from biodynamically farmed grapes that add some earthy nuances, but put too much emphasis on green tea, stemmy flavors.",Archery Summit,US,85,75,Pinot Noir
102969,Castoro Cellars 2005 Cobble Creek Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Earthy, soft and dry, this Zin has tobacco, cherry, blackberry and spice flavors, with an edge of sweet leather and pine. It's a refreshingly simple country-style Zin that will be nice with barbecue.",Castoro Cellars,US,85,26,Zinfandel
102970,French Hill 2005 Grand Reserve Barbera (Sierra Foothills),"Tastes young, sharp in acids and jammy sweet right now, with upfront cherry, raspberry and blackberry flavors. But after all, it is a California Barbera, and these puppies age forever. Give it some time, but don't expect it ever to become sophisticated.",French Hill,US,85,35,Barbera
102971,Vitis Terrarum 2003 Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"There's some stewed fruit weighing down this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon blend, but for the most part it has it going on. Coffee, oak and leather aromas set up a palate of raspberry, plum and chocolate. There's a fair amount of acid for an ‘03, and that lends legs to a wine that might otherwise seem tired.",Vitis Terrarum,Spain,85,29,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
102972,Vasse River 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Margaret River),"Seems rather oak-dominated, boasting ample brown sugar, vanilla and dill scents backed my some briary, blackberry fruit. Fills out a bit with air, so decant an hour or so prior to serving. Drink now.",Vasse River,Australia,85,24,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
102973,Kaleidos 2004 Morpheus Red (Paso Robles),"Like a trip through an orchard, this Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre blend bursts with flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries, tangerines, kumquats, dates, golden mangoes, yellow currants, the list goes on and on. It's a little on the sweet side, while grippy tannins give the palate handrails to negotiate this fruity ride.",Kaleidos,US,85,32,Rhône-style Red Blend
102974,Lovingston 2005 Josie's Knoll Merlot (Monticello),"This is a pretty eastern U.S. Merlot, with its subtle, nuanced flavors of red berry, plum and currant and its approachable, soft tannins. Virginia is showing its talent for growing reds and this is a good example of what can be done with good vineyard management and winemaking.",Lovingston,US,85,18,Merlot
102975,Sonoma Crest 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"With polished blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, this affordable Cab represents a good value. It's soft, dry and stylish, and easy to drink.",Sonoma Crest,US,85,10,Cabernet Sauvignon
102976,Château Haut Cabut 2014 Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"This ripe and spicy wine from the Dop family's 27 acres offers layers of black fruits. It has a concentrated texture and a firm structure that is juicy while dense. With this richness, the wine will develop into a smooth and generous wine. Drink from 2019.",Château Haut Cabut,France,91,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
102977,Château le Pey 2014 Médoc,"This Cru Bourgeois estate has produced a structured wine that is still showing strong wood-aging flavors. Toasty as well as ripely fruity, it has firm tannins and good aging potential. The aftertaste is fruity and spicy. Drink from 2019.",Château le Pey,France,91,23,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
102978,Château Montlandrie 2014 Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"This vineyard is at one of the highest Castillon points. Big in tannins and also fruit, this is a dense wine. It has a dry core as well as rich blackberry fruits. Concentrated and full, the wine will be seriously worth drinking from 2019.",Château Montlandrie,France,91,25,Merlot
102979,Clos Puy Arnaud 2014 Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"Owner Thierry Valette has been around the Right Bank (the family owned Pavie and owns Troplong Mondot) and, as a consultant, the world. Here he offers a delicious juicy wine with fine tannins and ripe red fruits. It has mint and spice perfumes along with balanced acidity. Drink this attractive wine from 2018.",Clos Puy Arnaud,France,91,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
102980,Closerie du Bailli 2014 Grande Réserve (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"This Alliance Bourg co-op wine is packed with minty new-wood aromas, this has the potential to be a smooth, polished wine.

103061,Argyle 2014 Nuthouse Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Light strawberry fruit with tart acidity carries a wine of modest proportions. It's drinking well, and might be a good choice for a simple salmon preparation, as it would not overwhelm the fish. The finishing tannins have a definite herbal flavor.",Argyle,US,88,50,Pinot Noir
103062,Flora Springs 2008 Hillside Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A wonderfully smooth, dry, complex young Cabernet, and yes, the tannins have that famous Rutherford dust. The wine is the opposite of a fruit bomb, with moderate alcohol and interesting flavors of herbs, cherries, blackberries and spicy sandalwood. As good as it is now, it should ride out the next 8–10 years.",Flora Springs,US,95,100,Cabernet Sauvignon
103063,Hirsch 2007 San Andreas Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Young and tart in cool-climate acidity, this Pinot needs time in the cellar. It's an exotic wine, spicy and peppery, almost briary, like a Zinfandel, except with flavors of wild forest raspberries, cherries, orange zest and a hint of pine cone. It's as cellarable a Pinot Noir as exists in California. Best after 2015.",Hirsch,US,95,60,Pinot Noir
103064,Joseph Drouhin 2008 Charmes-Chambertin,"Structured, concentrated, a wine that shows power from both fruit and tannins. The opulent strawberry flavors are paralleled by firm, dry tannins. As the combination comes together, this will become a glorious wine.",Joseph Drouhin,France,95,164,Pinot Noir
103065,DeLille 2009 Chaleur Estate Blanc White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Consistent year after year, this blend of 67% Sauvignon Blanc and 33% Sémillon is modeled after top-flight white Bordeaux. Deep gold, toasty and scented with olive oil, walnuts and loam, it hits the palate full-on with a rainbow of flavors: citrus, stone and tropical fruits, all accented with toast, oil and nuts from barrel aging. Riveting, delicious and unique.",DeLille,US,95,36,Bordeaux-style White Blend
103066,Benanti 2006 Serra della Contessa Red (Sicilia),"A stellar, superb wine that embodies all the grace, power and charm of the Mount Etna volcano in Sicily. This highly unique and distinctive territory has shaped an elegant expression of Nerello Mascalese (with 20% Nerello Cappuccio) offering aromas of wild berry set against delicately toasted pistachio nut. In the mouth, the wine is silky, compact and very persistent.",Benanti,Italy,94,49,Red Blend
103067,Maison Bleue 2009 Soleil Roussanne (Yakima Valley),"Another stellar effort from this terrific new winery. Luscious aromas—stone fruits, candy, wax, peel, honey, cumin, allspice—it just keeps on going. Firm in the mouth, with the same exotic and refined blend of interesting spices and fruits. A tour de force.",Maison Bleue,US,94,25,Roussanne
103068,Pax 2007 Kobler Family Vineyard Syrah (Green Valley),"Awesome. A superior California Syrah, one of the finest of the vintage. Although it's dry, it's massive in blackberry and blueberry pie filling fruit, with interesting complexities of smoked meats, black pepper, minerals from the earth, cola and sandalwood. Just delicious now, and should hold in the bottle over the next six years.",Pax,US,94,45,Syrah
103069,Chanson Père et Fils 2008 Charmes-Chambertin,"Big, full-bodied wine, the great tannins dominating the underlying red fruit. It's firmly concentrated, intense, a powerhouse of dense texture and obviously a wine that will need aging. Give it 5–6 years.",Chanson Père et Fils,France,94,190,Pinot Noir
103070,Chanson Père et Fils 2008 Clos de Vougeot,"Very dense wine, its tannins solid and concentrated. The structure is the leader here, with the young fruit showing through as black plum skins and crushed strawberries. This is a firmly tannic wine, needing aging.",Chanson Père et Fils,France,94,205,Pinot Noir
103071,Domaine de la Terre Rouge 2008 Ascent Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"A super-structured, incredibly textured Syrah from the Sierra Foothills, this is Bill Easton's best of the best lots, aptly named Ascent, that he puts out every year to showcase his deft handling of age-worthy Syrah. This one will continue to develop its earthy, dusty, bacon fat and cigar box qualities over time. A truly beautiful bottle of wine.",Domaine de la Terre Rouge,US,94,80,Syrah
103072,Domaine Leflaive 2008 Clavoillon Premier Cru (Puligny-Montrachet),"Beautiful lemon-scented wine, balancing rich butter and apricot flavors with intense, pure acidity. The wine at this stage is toast and fruit, still coalescing into its long-term future.",Domaine Leflaive,France,94,145,Chardonnay
103073,Joseph Drouhin 2008 Clos des Mouches Premier Cru (Beaune),"The aromas of smoky new wood follow through to the wood flavors on the palate. However, it's the powerful sweet black cherry and red berry fruit flavors, layered with fruit tannins and acidity, that are driving this impressive wine. For aging at least six years.",Joseph Drouhin,France,94,89,Pinot Noir
103074,Tyler 2008 Clos Pepe Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Lots of toasty oak on this Pinot, but also plenty of rich, unctuous fruit to support it. Shows ample flavors of cloves, cinnamon, ripe wild cherries, and earthy, forest floor notes of balsam and dried pine needles. The texture is lightly delicate and silky, with crisp acidity. Really shows off the Clos Pepe terroir in a delightful way.",Tyler,US,94,60,Pinot Noir
103075,Trefethen 2007 Dragon's Tooth Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"Unusually blended from all five Bordeaux varieties with Malbec dominating, this is a wonderfully, rich, complex wine. It shows jammy blackberry and plum flavors, with spice and cocoa overtones and firm, ripe tannins. The finish is dry and long. An impressive introductory wine from Trefethen, off the estate vineyard.",Trefethen,US,94,75,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
103076,Trefethen 2008 Dragon's Tooth Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"This vintage the wine is comprised of Malbec, Cabernet and Petit Verdot. It's a deeper, darker, richer wine than the '07, with which it was co-released, and equally high-scoring. Almost sweetly jammy in black cherries, raspberries, cola and caramelized oak, it's rescued by firm tannins and a finish that dries it out in minerals and spices. Now–2016.",Trefethen,US,94,75,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
103077,Alexandria Nicole 2008 Destiny Ridge Vineyard Destiny Red Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Supple, dark, and laced with licorice, cassis, and clove, this well-crafted Bordeaux blend does not scream high alcohol, though it tops 14.6%. What keeps it focused and precise are the vivid acids and sculpted tannins. It's the work of a young winemaker who is improving dramatically with each new vintage, even as his vineyard puts out better and better fruit.",Alexandria Nicole,US,94,45,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
103078,Lineage 2007 Red (Livermore Valley),"Though it's a huge tannic monster right now, this Bordeaux blend, a first release and new brand name from Steven Kent Winery, is an ode to Steven Kent Mirassou's family's long lineage in California winemaking and the roots of Livermore's history in wine as well. A majority Cabernet (75%), with all the lush cassis and black cherry one would hope for, the wine shows nicely honed herbal notes from its 15% Cab Franc in the middle, with a little touch of spice on the finish coming from 5% Petit Verdot (3% Malbec and 2% Merlot round out the blend). Give this one time and it will surely reward.",Lineage,US,94,125,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
103079,Buty 2009 Merlot-Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Wide open and seductive, this brings together grapes from both Conner Lee (northern Columbia Basin) and Champoux (Horse Heaven Hills). Muscular, ripe and round, the sweet blackberry and cassis fruit is limned with a granite-like minerality. Great concentration and layering—a berry/rock/tannin layer cake.",Buty,US,94,40,Merlot-Cabernet Franc
103080,McCrea 2006 Boushey Grande Côte Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"This particular bottling belongs with the very best Syrahs from this Syrah-infatuated state. A broad, toasty, full-bodied and fully realized wine, it has begun to smooth out from the extra years in bottle, but has a long life ahead. Berries, cherries, chocolate, coffee, mocha, tobacco, fungus, graphite… the flavors go and go.",McCrea,US,94,36,Syrah
103081,Torbreck 2007 Descendant Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa Valley),"Full bodied and concentrated without being overly heavy or tannic, this is a stunning blend of Shiraz (92%) and Viognier (8%). Hints of roasted or grilled meat and black olive balance the bold blackberry fruit, leaving behind a lingering finish of warmth and dusty cocoa. Drink now–2020.",Torbreck,Australia,94,105,Shiraz-Viognier
103082,Beringer 2008 Alluvium Blanc Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Knights Valley),"As always, Beringer's Alluvium blend is a complex white wine, meant to pair with good food. The '08 is comprised of Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon, Chardonnay and Viognier. It's fruity, crisp and dry.",Beringer,US,88,17,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon
103083,Corte Sant' Alda 2007 Campi Magri (Valpolicella Superiore),Campo Magri is a bright and lively Valpolicella Superiore with crisp tones of cherry and wild berry backed by slight smoke and spice. The natural acidity will cut through the density or ossobuco or beef stew.,Corte Sant' Alda,Italy,88,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
103084,Corteforte 2007 Podere Bertarole (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),"This vineyard-designate Ripasso opens with dark concentration and lush aromas of mature fruit, spice, leather, chocolate and dried beef or cured ham. This is a rich and velvety wine that could stand up to barbecued short ribs smothered in spicy sauce.",Corteforte,Italy,88,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
103085,Fabiano 2008 Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,"Fabiano's newest Ripasso opens with bright cherry aromas followed by spice, clove, black pepper and pressed rose petal. The wine boasts a soft, steady feel in the mouth and relatively smooth texture overall.",Fabiano,Italy,88,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
103086,Gamba 2007 Le Quare (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),"Instead of brawn and muscle, this ruby Ripasso offers elegance and finesse. The nose is redolent of polished black stone, Indian spice and loads of dried cassis and wild berry. There's a playful hint of sweet almond and cinnamon at the end.",Gamba,Italy,88,16,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
103087,Hogue 2009 Pinot Grigio (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Another fine effort in a continuing series of outstanding PGs from Hogue. This is tart and stylish, loaded with citrus and bracingly acidic. Flavors meld lemon, lime, lemon verbena, orange peel and a slice of pear.",Hogue,US,88,11,Pinot Grigio
103088,Bell 2007 Claret Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A little on the soft side, but very dry, with smoky oak and blackberry fruit dominating. Feels good and chewy and rich, with interesting herb and spice notes. Will age for a few years, but not for a long time. Give it a good decant.",Bell,US,88,35,Cabernet Sauvignon
103089,Brigaldara 2007 Il Vegro (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),Ripasso Il Vegro offers a rich and meaty bouquet with aromas of cured beef and honey roasted ham. There are also bright fruit tones of cherry and blackberry and the wine adds a crisp touch of sour cranberry at the very end.,Brigaldara,Italy,88,22,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
103090,Cadence 2008 Coda Red (Red Mountain),"Tapteil, Ciel and Cara Mia vineyard fruit, a blend of 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot, 28% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Young and tight, with the characteristic Cadence chalk and stone undertone. The fruit is pretty strawberry, with a peppery herbal streak, good length and fine balance.",Cadence,US,88,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
103091,Latium di Morini 2005 Campo Leòn (Amarone della Valpolicella),"Campo Leòn is a jammy, chewy wine with raw notes of black cherry, Indian spice, cedar wood and melted chocolate. It's thick, syrupy and it's hard to imagine a balanced food pairing outside succulent red meat.",Latium di Morini,Italy,88,55,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
103092,Luigi Righetti 2006 Capitel de' Roari (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"This is a smooth and rich Amarone with equal parts jammy fruit set against a smokey oak component. The wine slides nicely over the palate with a lavish, velvety texture and imparts more oak spice and mesquite on the close.",Luigi Righetti,Italy,88,35,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
103093,Marquee 2008 Signature Chardonnay (Yarra Valley),"A lively, balanced wine at an accessible price point, Marquee's 2008 Signature Chard boasts aromas of smoke, vanilla and stone fruit and flavors that follow along similar lines, with white peach and pineapple coming to the fore. Drink now–2012.",Marquee,Australia,88,15,Chardonnay
103094,Miguel Torres 2007 Manso de Velasco Viejas Viñas Old Vines Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),"A bit mulchy and swampy for Manso, with earthy tobacco and generic berry fruit aromas. The palate is flush and a little heavy, with creamy flavors of vanilla, dill weed and cassis. Soft and sweet late, with chunkiness and a medium to basic structure. A very good wine but not great as in past years.",Miguel Torres,Chile,88,42,Cabernet Sauvignon
103095,Mittnacht Frères 2009 Terre d'Etoiles Pinot Blanc (Alsace),"Classic, soft, easy and broad Pinot Blanc. There is an attractive buttery character to go with the peach and lime flavors. The wine is ripe, with pure fruit and a final tang of acidity.",Mittnacht Frères,France,88,18,Pinot Blanc
103096,Monte del Frá 2005 Tenuta Lena di Mezzo (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"This is a powerful but not exaggerated style of Amarone that delivers ripe cherry and blackberry aromas followed by new leather, cigar box, spice and rum cake. It imparts a very smooth, rich and supple feel.",Monte del Frá,Italy,88,50,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
103097,Montresor 2006 Giacomo Montresor (Amarone della Valpolicella),"A 70-30 blend of Corvina and Rondinella, this bright Amarone offers simple but genuine aromas of forest berry, toasted almond, cherry cola and vanilla bean. The wine is smooth, polished and crisp on the close.",Montresor,Italy,88,45,Red Blend
103098,Musella 2005 Riserva (Amarone della Valpolicella),"This Riserva Amarone shows a meaty, bold, sweet and jammy personality with loads of aromatic intensity. It's almost too much of a good thing with overripe flavors of prune and berry marmalade.",Musella,Italy,88,44,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
103099,Paso a Paso 2009 Verdejo (La Mancha),"The best Paso a Paso white yet; it's ripe and smells of pineapple and melon, while the palate is pure and has a solid feel. Flavors of apple, peach and pithy citrus are honest, and the finish is clean. Delivers what it should and more.",Paso a Paso,Spain,88,10,Verdejo
103100,Penfolds 2007 Bin 128 Shiraz (Coonawarra),"From a cooler region than its Bin 28 stablemate, Penfolds' 2007 Bin 128 is a medium-bodied Shiraz that features touches of peppery spice, raspberry-cherry fruit and a darker edge of chocolate and coffee. The tannins are supple without being soft, giving this a drinking window that should extend through 2017 or so.",Penfolds,Australia,88,26,Shiraz
103101,Qupé 2008 Purisima Mountain Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"A beautiful Syrah. It's very dry and softly tannic, with complex blackberry, black cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors. Could be firmer in structure, but a lovely wine to drink now.",Qupé,US,88,35,Syrah
103102,Ridge 2007 California Monte Bello Red (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Not the best Monte Bello to emerge in recent years. There's a sharpness of acidity that cuts the palate, and it accentuates the fresh fruit, giving it a jammy zing. More troubling is an overripe raisiny flavor. This bottling is, of course, one of the most ageable in California, but the inherent imbalance seems to mitigate against long time in the cellar.",Ridge,US,88,145,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
103103,Santa Ema 2007 Catalina Red (Peumo),"Smoky, rubbery and sweet on the nose, with mocha and caramel shadings. The palate, however, is more tight and narrow; the feel is fresh and blazing, while the flavors are piercing and suggest red fruits like cranberry and cherry. Citric but with just enough weight to register as true Cabernet (with 18% Carmenère and 7% Cab Franc).",Santa Ema,Chile,88,40,Red Blend
103104,Cono Sur 2008 20 Barrels Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),"Bold and spicy, with a lot of cinnamon, licorice and toasty aromas. Quite intense in the mouth, where black cherry, toast and vanilla flavors lead the charge. The finish is tangy and long, with coffee and citrus accents coming along late in the game. Made from whole berries fermented in open-top vats.",Cono Sur,Chile,88,24,Pinot Noir
103105,Cono Sur 2009 Visión Viognier (Colchagua Valley),"An interesting and unsual wine for Chile. Hailing from grafted vines originally planted to Chenin Blanc in 1956, this Viognier is superfloral, with oily aromas along with apple blossom, nectarine and apricot. The palate has nice natural acidity and sweet flavors of melon, mango and citrus. A little big and unfocused and sweet, but still intriguing and nicely made.",Cono Sur,Chile,88,13,Viognier
103106,Corte San Benedetto 2003 Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"Corte San Benedetto is a small, family run winery and its 2003 Amarone shows ripe notes of black cherry, mesquite, blackberry and soft vanilla. The oak element is evident here; the wine is soft and supple on the close.",Corte San Benedetto,Italy,88,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
103107,Domìni Veneti 2006 Verjago (Valpolicella Classico Superiore),"Loads of aromatic intensity comes through on the bouquet with lovely layers of ripe cherry, spice, mesquite wood, Indian spice and cola. The oak element is evident here and will integrate with a bit more time in the bottle. In the mouth, this rich, ruby-colored wine offers jammy fruit and soft, velvety texture.",Domìni Veneti,Italy,88,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
103108,Dopff & Irion NV Cuvée Prestige Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"A mature, serious wine, showing toasty flavors that are rounding out the fruit. A definite food wine, its richness tempered with a bite of acidity and delicious final crispness.",Dopff & Irion,France,88,30,Sparkling Blend
103109,Falezza 2005 Amarone della Valpolicella,"Here's a new producer from Valpolicella who presents a sharp and angular Amarone with fine aromas of spice, wild berry, black tobacco and tea leaf. The wine is bright and compact with soft tannins and natural freshness.",Falezza,Italy,88,,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
103110,Rieflé 2006 Pinot Gris Bonheur Convivial Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Rich and spicy, this is a fine, dry, peppery Pinot Gris. In the mouth there's weight and ripeness, as well as some fat, yellow fruits. There's a touch of lychee as well, giving an exotic edge to the finish.",Rieflé,France,88,,Pinot Gris
103111,Casa Silva 2005 Microterroir de los Lingues Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"A lot of olive and herbs upfront, with cumin and other exotic, arguably unusual aromas. The palate is soft and a little low on structure, but the flavors are big and sweet, almost overripe and syrupy. There's cola, blackberry, coffee and mulchy herbal flavors from start to finish. A big wine that needs to be drunk now; it's not going to get better.",Casa Silva,Chile,88,49,Carmenère
103112,Château Lamothe-Vincent 2011 Le Grand Rossignol du Château Lamothe Vincent (Bordeaux Supérieur),"With light toast aromas, this is a wine that shows vanilla from wood aging more than its fruitiness. There is a barnyard edge to it that brings out rusticity. On the finish, acidity does bring some freshness.",Château Lamothe-Vincent,France,84,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
103113,Château Pey la Tour 2011 Bordeaux,"Structure keeps this firm, dry wine solidly closed. It is tightly wound at this stage, only hinting at a brighter, fruity future. Drink after 2015.",Château Pey la Tour,France,84,15,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
103114,Clayhouse 2011 Red Cedar Vineyard Estate Syrah-Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Sweet oak and rich cherry jam combine to make this blend distinctly candied in nature. It's a straightforward, simple with smooth tannins.",Clayhouse,US,84,35,Syrah-Petite Sirah
103115,Dilecta 2011 The Tiller Caliza Vineyard Russell Family Vineyards Grenache-Syrah (Paso Robles),"This wine is mostly Grenache, with about one-third Syrah blended in. There are pleasant cherry and blackberry flavors on the palate, but also a mushroomy streak that distracts. It's not likely to improve with age so drink up.",Dilecta,US,84,52,Grenache-Syrah
103116,Grayson 2012 Lot 10 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Harsh in mouthfeel, this Cab has cherry, black currant and wintergreen mint flavors, wrapped into firm but fine tannins. For the price, it's not bad for everyday fare.",Grayson,US,84,11,Cabernet Sauvignon
103117,Vinemark 2011 Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"This is a candied Pinot with flavors of pink bubblegum, raspberries and strawberries. Give it some time in the glass and drink up.",Vinemark,US,84,32,Pinot Noir
103118,Wetzel Estate 2010 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The fruit flavors never get past light, tart cranberry in this wine, and there is an earthy tinge that runs through the palate and into the finish. It's thin and tannic in style.",Wetzel Estate,US,84,38,Pinot Noir
103119,Magnolia Court 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),"This rustic Cabernet has pretty good varietal flavors of blackberries and dried currants, enhanced with an oaky sweetness. It's full bodied and tannic, and fine for drinking now.",Magnolia Court,US,84,13,Cabernet Sauvignon

103121,Recuerdo 2011 Malbec (Uco Valley),"Recuerdo is the house brand from the Vines of Mendoza project, which is relying on young Tupungato vineyards that expand annually. This vintage shows floral berry aromas along with Middle East spice notes of cumin and curry. In the mouth, it's sharp and hollow, like an elevator that skips floors. Clipped flavors of boysenberry are acidic, while the finish lacks substance.",Recuerdo,Argentina,84,22,Malbec
103122,Adanti 2009 Montefalco Rosso,"Made with Sangiovese, Sagrantino, Barbera, Merlot and Cabernet, this wine opens with dominant oak aromas that carry through to the palate alongside subdued notes of prune and fig. It lacks fruit richness and freshness to support the oak.",Adanti,Italy,84,18,Red Blend
103123,Château Haut Nadeau 2011 Réserve du Propriétaire (Bordeaux Supérieur),"This wine has a lean side that takes away from the bright acidity and fruitiness. With its berry fruit flavors, it should be rich, but lacks a middle.",Château Haut Nadeau,France,84,13,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
103124,un4seen 2011 Chardonnay (Lodi),"A strong pineapple and mango imprint persists throughout this Chardonnay, along with bright acidity and a floral finish.",un4seen,US,84,10,Chardonnay

103127,Del Rio 2010 Claret (Rogue Valley),"Coming from the cool 2010 vintage, this blend of half Merlot along with four other Bordeaux grape varieties brings notes of toast, bittersweet chocolate, citrus and cranberry. It's tart and puckering with tightly wound tannins that need time to resolve.",Del Rio,US,84,35,Claret
103128,Grayson 2012 Pinot Noir (California),"This isn't the most complicated Pinot Noir, but it is a clean, easy-drinking wine. With raspberry and cherry flavors wrapped into a silky texture, it will be fine to drink with burgers.",Grayson,US,84,12,Pinot Noir

Drink now into 2010.",Salentein,Argentina,89,20,Malbec

Glass stopper.",Sattlerhof,Austria,89,25,Sauvignon Blanc
103139,Steininger 2006 Brut Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"A ripe, fragrant wine that also manages to retain fine crispness.

103140,Summerer 2007 Steinhaus Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Fresh but rich, this young wine has structured edges, great purity of green currant fruits as well as fine concentration.

103141,Robert Stemmler 2005 Ferguson Block Pinot Noir (Carneros),"The flavors of this Pinot, made from pre-Dijon clone Martini selection vines, are fine.

If the wine had a crisper, livelier mouthfeel, it would score a lot higher.",Robert Stemmler,US,89,44,Pinot Noir
103142,Tamarack Cellars 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is spicy and varietally specific, with sharp, tight, bright red berry flavors and a peppery finish.

103144,Coeur d'Alene 2005 Switchback Red Red (Washington),"Coeur d'Alene Cellars does a fine job with Syrah. This has much the same satiny, sexy black fruit as the more expensive Opulence bottling, but it is more accessible and forward, with less power in the back end. Still, it's quite delicious, and the smoky tannins add some extra authority.",Coeur d'Alene,US,89,25,Red Blend
103145,Bouchard Aîné & Fils 2005 Les Marconnets Premier Cru (Beaune),"Typical Beaune in its round, soft character.

103146,Whitman Cellars 2005 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A dark and richly spicy wine, with penetrating varietal scents of pepper and berry. The wine is tart and youthful, and along with the tangy flavors of berry and spice there is a layer of graphite and a hint of cured meat reaching into the finish.

103148,Helix by Reininger 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a welcome return for this value Merlot after the 2004 vintage was skipped. The smooth and chocolaty flavors that consumers love are there, but they have been pulled back, letting more of the cherry fruit and subtle accents of forest floor, fungus and earth show through. It's textural, complex and thoroughly enjoyable.",Helix by Reininger,US,89,22,Merlot
103149,Tomero 2007 Torrontés (Salta),"Tomero is a new line from the Carlos Pulenta group, and this one sings the tale of Salta with sincerity.

The palate is lightly oily but linear, while the papaya, citrus and melon flavors just roll along.",Tomero,Argentina,89,12,Torrontés
103150,Trivento 2005 Golden Reserve Malbec (Mendoza),"An intense, forward style of Malbec. The nose oozes a mixture of mint, black-fruit extract and shoe polish, while the saturated palate is racy and just rich enough; the flavors of blackberry and plum are lively with coffee and mocha accents on the finish. A bit acidic and racy, but that won't hurt it if served with food.",Trivento,Argentina,89,20,Malbec
103151,Breggo 2006 Ferrington Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Anderson Valley),"Too bad the vineyard owner is pulling out the Sauvignon Blanc, because this is a fresh, vibrant, juicy one, crisp in acidity and rich in citrus, figs, pears and melons.

103154,Tagaris 2006 Alice Vineyard Malbec (Wahluke Slope),"This is a dark, sappy, saturated wine, and the power and grip of the fruit belies its claim of 12.9% alcohol.

Thoroughly delicious and captivating.",Tagaris,US,89,30,Malbec
103155,Torres 2005 Celeste Crianza (Ribera del Duero),"Torres' Celeste debuted in 2003, and the '05 is the best vintage to date.

Drink now.",Stoneburn,New Zealand,86,12,Pinot Noir
103158,Trivento 2010 Reserve Malbec (Mendoza),"Fresh and reasonably fruity on the nose, but it's also slightly gritty and tough.

103225,Real Sitio de Ventosilla 2004 RSV 1601 El Duque de Lerma (Ribera del Duero),"With damp earth and crusty leather aromas, this is a heavy wine with baked fruit, a syrupy mouthfeel and flavors of mocha, carob, leafy berry and earth. On the finish, it's full bodied and soft, with ripe black-fruit flavors that register as thick and a touch raisiny. Drink now.",Real Sitio de Ventosilla,Spain,88,75,Tempranillo
103226,Stryker Sonoma 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Masses of sweet blackberry jam give this Cabernet an easy deliciousness. The fruit and oak are balanced with fine tannins and a gentle scour of acidity. Not one for the cellar, but it will benefit from an hour or two in the decanter.",Stryker Sonoma,US,88,35,Cabernet Sauvignon
103227,Talamonti 2012 Trabocchetto Pecorino (Colline Pescaresi),Pecorino is a fascinating white grape from Central Italy that deserves a special look. This expression bursts open with tones of acacia flower and stone fruit and delivers medium density and richness on the finish.,Talamonti,Italy,88,19,Pecorino
103228,The Eyrie Vineyards 2011 Estate Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),"This fine-honed Chardonnay hews to the Eyrie house style. It may seem austere at first, but the green and yellow fruit flavors are ripe, not vegetal, and the firm acidity makes it a fine food match. Give it plenty of time to breathe before serving.",The Eyrie Vineyards,US,88,27,Chardonnay
103229,The Farm Winery 2009 Touchy-Feely G-S-M (Paso Robles),"This Rhône-style blend is fruity and delicious. It has raspberry, cherry, licorice, mocha and spice flavors, wrapped into easy tannins, brightened with a bite of lime acidity. Ready to enjoy now.",The Farm Winery,US,88,60,G-S-M
103230,Tre Monti 2009 Thea Riserva (Sangiovese di Romagna Superiore),"Thea Riserva opens with dark and austere notes of black licorice, tar, black cherry and crushed granite. There's a dusty quality to the close followed by a dry but fresh finish.",Tre Monti,Italy,88,21,Sangiovese
103231,Trueheart 2010 Truehart Vineyard Petite Sirah (Sonoma Valley),"Shows the dark color, thick tannins and deep, concentrated flavors you expect from Petite Sirah. It's a big gulp of blackberry jam, espresso, dark chocolate and crushed black pepper, and the finish is thoroughly dry. Lacks the acidic vibrancy needed for aging, but a fine wine to drink now.",Trueheart,US,88,35,Petite Sirah
103232,Val do Sosego 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Ripe apple aromas make the nose nice, even though it's flattening with age. Likewise on the palate, which delivers pithy orange and dry melon flavors along with indications that it's just starting to fade. Notes of green herbs and scallion come up on the finish. Drink this mature white immediately.",Val do Sosego,Spain,88,17,Albariño
103233,J. Christopher 2010 Nuages Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"A blend of grapes from several vineyards, this is named for a famous jazz tune. The blending both softens and expands the mid-palate, and seems to have boosted the aging curve. It's ready to drink, with strawberry fruit, a dusting of cocoa, a hint of wet cement, and a finish with cola and sassafras.",J. Christopher,US,88,35,Pinot Noir
103234,J. Lohr 2010 Gesture G-S-M (Paso Robles),"Frankly delicious, offering wave after wave of black cherry jam, red currant, licorice, mocha, vanilla and buttered cinnamon toast flavors, wrapped into soft, smooth tannins.",J. Lohr,US,88,35,G-S-M
103235,Johanneshof Reinisch 2012 Rotgipfler (Thermenregion),"Rotgipfler is almost an exclusivity to Thermenregion. This bright, fruity wine is deliciously crisp with spice, pepper and pear flavors. It has a light lemon edge brought out by the refreshing acidity. Screwcap.",Johanneshof Reinisch,Austria,88,20,Rotgipfler
103236,Lynmar 2011 Monastery Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This is one of Lynmar's most expensive Chardonnays, of their six 2011s. It's also one of the most forward and oakiest. Your first impression is of sweet buttered toast, sprinkled with brown sugar and drizzled with melted butterscotch. Then the tropical fruits kick in, brightened with citrusy acids. It's an impressive feat, but the wine feels overworked, and lacks the sustaining interest of Lynmar's other bottlings.",Lynmar,US,88,70,Chardonnay
103237,Matetic 2011 EQ Chardonnay (San Antonio),"The nose sends up signals of a balanced, easygoing wine with oak blended nicely into pear and apple fruit. The palate is lively and mildly oaky, with baked apple, orange and woodspice flavors. A snappy, oaky finish with intense acidity closes the show.",Matetic,Chile,88,,Chardonnay
103238,Oliver Conti 2011 Treyu White (Empordà),"The nose on this blend of Gewurztraminer and Macabeo defines neutral; it's clean but shows little more than a whiff of apple. The palate is fresh and quick moving, with mild peach, pear, apple and melon flavors that culminate in a solid finish that's not very exciting but doesn't stray.",Oliver Conti,Spain,88,16,White Blend
103239,Parcel 41 2011 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This is a good value for a sophisticated Merlot from Napa Valley. It's not an ager, but it's delightful now for its dryness, smooth tannins and complex cherry and red currant flavors with hints of herbs and sweet peas.",Parcel 41,US,88,19,Merlot
103240,Drei Donà Tenuta La Palazza 2009 Pruno Riserva (Sangiovese di Romagna Superiore),There's a dark and masculine quality to this Sangiovese from Romagna that makes this wine perfect for pork or breaded veal. Dark cherry and prune are backed by bright acidity.,Drei Donà Tenuta La Palazza,Italy,88,40,Sangiovese
103241,401K 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"A gentle wine, this has warm, fruity aromas, ripe red cherry and raspberry flavors, a soft texture and fine-grained tannins. Medium to full bodied and almost sweet in balance, it's easy to enjoy.",401K,US,86,15,Cabernet Sauvignon
103242,Barnard Griffin 2014 Fumé Blanc Dry Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A mix of Sauvignon Blanc (77%) and Sémillon, this wine comes from three separate vineyards in the Columbia Valley. It shows plenty of Sauvignon's herbal character while also displaying the ripeness of the vintage, with lightly spritzy tropical fruit and fig flavors that possess a fleshy feel.",Barnard Griffin,US,86,9,Sauvignon Blanc
103243,Cana's Feast 2013 Northridge Vineyard Primitivo (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine doesn't seem to have fully ripened, with green, reedy aromas along with notes of cranberry and cherry Jolly Rancher. The full-bodied palate delivers more but seems disconnected with tart, tangy cranberry flavors.",Cana's Feast,US,86,30,Primitivo
103244,Cantine Leonardo Da Vinci 2010 Da Vinci Riserva (Chianti),"Aromas of toast, oak, espresso and a whiff of smoke lead the nose. The palate offers oak extract, coconut, coffee and vanilla but there's not enough fruit richness to support the oak. It's already reached its ideal drinking window so enjoy sooner rather than later.",Cantine Leonardo Da Vinci,Italy,86,23,Red Blend
103245,Hill Family Estate 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A stamp of smoke and toasted oak mark the entry into this wine, followed by chewy tannins that wrap themselves around dark layers of chocolate and tobacco leaf, the structure at first impenetrable. The finish is relaxed and somewhat short.",Hill Family Estate,US,86,55,Cabernet Sauvignon
103246,James Wyatt 2013 Untamed Cuvée Red (Yakima Valley),"This lightly colored wine blends Grenache (43%), Syrah (32%) and Mourvèdre. It brings aromas of red raspberries, currant and flowers. The palate is fresh and lighter in style, with the emphasis on fruit.",James Wyatt,US,86,20,Red Blend
103247,Liebart-Régnier NV Brut (Champagne),"There are flavors of peanuts as well as the more usual white fruits in this wine that is rounded and soft, with gentle acidity. The wine, fresh at the end, is ready to drink.",Liebart-Régnier,France,86,56,Champagne Blend
103248,Vinum 2013 White Elephant White (California),"This tradition-bucking blend of 61% Chenin Blanc, 31% Viognier and 8% Roussanne offers soft aromas of sweet apple blossoms and peach, with a hint of barrel smoke. The palate offers a similar blend of peaches, pears and apples, warmed up with some oak influence.",Vinum,US,86,18,White Blend
103249,Viticoltori Senesi Aretini 2009 Riserva (Chianti),"Aromas of toast, milk chocolate and black-skinned fruit lead the way. The soft, low-acid palate doles out crushed plum, fleshy cherry and mocha alongside drying, angular tannins that create an abrupt finish.",Viticoltori Senesi Aretini,Italy,86,18,Sangiovese
103250,Wise Villa 2013 Estate Grown Sangiovese (Placer County),"A strong oak influence dampens the varietal character in this full-bodied, spicy wine. It smells like cinnamon and cedar, tastes slightly sweet and smoky, is full bodied and rich in texture. Nice and smooth, it shows only mild varietal character.",Wise Villa,US,86,35,Sangiovese
103251,MacPhail 2014 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a substantial wine, concentrated in dark red berry color and flavor, from cherry to wild strawberry to more savory rhubarb compote. Muted on the nose, it has an underlying woody, herbal character that balances the vibrancy of the fruit.",MacPhail,US,86,22,Pinot Noir
103252,Maison Bouey 2012 Château Lestruelle (Médoc),"If only this wine wasn't extracted so much (which gives bitterness), it would be ripe and fruity. As it is, it's hard to get past the tight, dry tannins. There are hints of juiciness and black currant fruits. It might soften by 2016.",Maison Bouey,France,86,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
103253,Maison Bouey 2014 Le Rosé Gourmand de Lestruelle Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"This crisp, fruity wine has delicious acidity. Gray-pink in color, it is ripe with red berries that also impart attractive freshness. The wine is crisp, tangy and textured at the end.",Maison Bouey,France,86,,Rosé
103254,Mannucci Droandi 2009 Ceppeto Riserva (Chianti Classico),"This blend of Sangiovese and 10% Merlot opens with aromas of forest floor, ripe blackberry, cedar and menthol. The warm, evolved palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, mint, ground pepper and a gamy note alongside assertive, almost gritty tannins that leave an astringent finish.",Mannucci Droandi,Italy,86,31,Red Blend
103255,Rosenblum 2012 Winemaker Selection Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Flavors of berry, vanilla and tar form around thick, rich tannins, giving this wine a puckering quality that may benefit from opening before enjoying. The finish is sturdy and robust in leathery black pepper.",Rosenblum,US,86,55,Zinfandel
103256,Travignoli 2013 Chianti Rufina,"Here's a bright, informal red that offers sour cherry, red berry and a light note of cooking spice. Lively acidity and soft, rather fleeting tannins give it an easy-drinking quality.",Travignoli,Italy,86,13,Sangiovese
103257,Hanaiali'i 2013 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This 100% Merlot offers a lot of heat around its otherwise approachable lift of soft, smooth tannins and reasonable oak. Sage, cedar and tobacco provide a weedy aspect to the wine, offset by plenty of ripe blackberry and cherry.",Hanaiali'i,US,86,30,Merlot
103258,Lagana 2013 Breezy Slope Vineyard Pinot Noir (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Grown in the southern section of the valley in the foothills of the Blue Mountains, this rare varietal bottling from this appellation shows aromas of cranberry, raspberry and citrus, along with some hints of oxidation. It's tart and full in feel, not seeming entirely varietally correct.",Lagana,US,86,35,Pinot Noir
103259,Lagana 2013 Minnick Hills Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is an aromatically brooding wine with notes of herbs, pepper and brown spices. It drinks quite sweet with a lightly chalky feel.",Lagana,US,86,30,Syrah
103260,Loft 2013 Merlot (Monterey),"This is box wine taken seriously, even featuring a picture of winemaker Denise Wordenon. Fresh-squeezed blueberry fruit mixes with black rocks, milk chocolate and cedar on the nose, followed by an easy-to-quaff juiciness on the lightly bodied palate. It's not very complex, but perfect for summer barbecues or car camping.",Loft,US,86,30,Merlot
103261,Matsu 2013 El Picaro (Toro),"Rough, animal-like aromas wrestle with piercing, fairly hot plum and berry scents. Rubbery, blackened, peppery plum and raspberry flavors finish oaky, mildly bitter and tannic.",Matsu,Spain,86,15,Tinta de Toro
103262,Nadler 2014 Grüner Veltliner (Carnuntum),"The nose here is not quite as clean-cut as it could be, while the palate shows a little more focus. Crisp and zesty, if a little short.",Nadler,Austria,86,12,Grüner Veltliner
103263,:Nota Bene 2011 Ciel du Cheval Red (Red Mountain),"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this offers aromas of raisinated cherries, herbs, bittersweet chocolate and a whiff of barnyard. Medicinal flavors are backed by chalky tannins.",:Nota Bene,US,86,40,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
103264,Oyster Bay 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"At this scale (170,000 cases imported), the quality is remarkable. Leafy notes accent pink grapefruit aromas and flavors, coming together in a harmonious, easy-drinking finish.",Oyster Bay,New Zealand,86,15,Sauvignon Blanc
103265,Piot-Sévillano NV Tradition Brut (Champagne),"Rounded, soft and smoothly creamy, this is a ripe wine dominated by Pinot Meunier. It's an open wine, fruity and ready to drink.",Piot-Sévillano,France,86,,Champagne Blend
103266,Quai de la Lune 2014 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"Well-crafted and fruity, this has a fresh character that allows room for red berry flavors. It's a ripe wine, keeping freshness while bringing in a warmer, caramel character.",Quai de la Lune,France,86,11,Rosé
103267,Bodegas Berceo 2013 Viñadrian (Rioja),"Earthy notes of saline and cheesy leather accent plum aromas on this tight number with rubbery tannins. Plum, cherry and herbal flavors carry some bitterness onto a finish with medicinal plum notes.",Bodegas Berceo,Spain,86,15,Tempranillo Blend
103268,Cennatoio 2011 O'Leandro Riserva (Chianti Classico),"Made with Sangiovese and a small percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of coconut, toast and oak-driven spice. The evolved palate offers coconut, clove and ground black pepper but the fruit richness has almost dried up entirely, leaving an astringent finish.",Cennatoio,Italy,86,45,Red Blend
103269,Château Buisson-Redon 2014 Bordeaux Blanc,"Intense with acidity and young fruitiness, this wine needs some time. The potential of the white and citrus fruit is there, with an herbaceous character that needs to soften. Drink from late 2015.",Château Buisson-Redon,France,86,14,Bordeaux-style White Blend
103270,St. Supéry 2014 Estate Grown Moscato (Napa Valley),"This wine made from Muscat Canelli grapes is slightly spritzy and sweet, pungent in apricot fuzz and grass, a mélange of tropical goodness from there on out. Mango, kiwi and pineapple fill the medium-weight waves of viscous texture, concluding in a vanilla-tinged, light, fresh finish.",St. Supéry,US,86,25,Moscato
103271,Clos de Gamot 2002 Cuvée des Vignes Centenaires Malbec (Cahors),"This is a traditional style—emphasizing earthy tannins and spicy fruit and is rough around the edges—but is a wine that would relish being partnered with sausages, salamis and hard cheeses. There is plenty of weight, the acidity coming from minerality and wood.",Clos de Gamot,France,87,50,Malbec
103272,Companhia das Quintas 2007 Prova Régia Arinto (Bucelas),"Not many wines come from Bucelas today, as its vineyards get eaten up by the northern Lisbon suburbs. This Arinto-based wine suggests there should be some more of this ultra-crisp white, which bears a passing resemblance to a Vinho Verde in its super-fresh apple and grapefruit flavors.",Companhia das Quintas,Portugal,87,10,Arinto
103273,Cusumano 2007 Cubìa Insolia (Sicilia),"Pretty mineral notes recall chalk and dusty ash and provide depth and dimension to this fresh and fragrant white wine. There's not much fruit, but the wine pulls its own thanks to those mineral nuances and its crisp acidity.",Cusumano,Italy,87,18,Insolia
103274,DFJ Vinhos 2007 Casa do Lago Rosé Touriga Nacional (Estremadura),"An attractive salmon pink-colored wine, very fresh, with bright red currant acidity, fleshed out with some caramel, raspberry and a dash of red apple skins texture.",DFJ Vinhos,Portugal,87,10,Touriga Nacional
103275,Tasca d'Almerita 2006 Lamùri Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),"Molasses, smoked bacon, beef jerky and loads of clove and exotic spice come to mind. Lamùri is a pure expression of Nero d'Avola that also offers plum, prune and blackberry. Despite the mature fruit flavors, the wine has good acidity and crispness.",Tasca d'Almerita,Italy,87,28,Nero d'Avola
103276,Tenuta delle Terre Nere 2007 Etna,"This is a mineral-driven wine from the blackened slopes of Mount Etna with delicate shadings of pear, peach, jasmine and honeysuckle. The overall impression is one of elegance—thanks to the jasmine notes in particular. It's a very special wine. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.",Tenuta delle Terre Nere,Italy,87,19,White Blend
103277,Tolosa 2007 Edna Ranch Rosé (Edna Valley),"With the wonderfully crisp acidity and bright, laser-pure fruit Edna Valley is known for, this Syrah, Grenache and Viognier blush offers a wealth of tasty raspberry, cherry, citrus fruit and spice flavors. Dry and clean, it shows California rosé near its best.",Tolosa,US,87,18,Rosé
103278,Turkey Flat 2005 The Turk Shiraz-Grenache-Cabernet-Mourvèdre Red (Barossa Valley),"This blend is mainly Shiraz (50%) and Grenache (28%), which accounts for the wine's ample, plummy fruit flavors. Accents of grilled meat and slightly briary overtones add complexity, and the wine finishes dry and savory. Drink now-2012.",Turkey Flat,Australia,87,18,Red Blend
103279,J. Portugal Ramos 2007 Marquês de Borba Red (Alentejo),"Portugal's popular brand is a lively, fresh, spice- and dried fruit-flavored wine. There are flavors of pound cake and nutmeg surrounding a core of solid, firm tannins. Great with food, this is not for aging.",J. Portugal Ramos,Portugal,87,14,Portuguese Red
103280,J Vineyards & Winery 2006 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Sturdy and hard in tannins, brisk in acids, this Pinot will benefit from a year or so in bottle. It's extremely dry, with earthy, balsam and mushroom-inspired flavors of blackberries, black cherries and cola.",J Vineyards & Winery,US,87,38,Pinot Noir
103281,J. Wilkes 2006 Bien Nacido Vineyard Hillside Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Light in color and texture, with a silky, airy mouthfeel, this Pinot has elegant flavors of cherries, anise, vanilla, Asian spices and smoky wood. It's a polished wine for drinking now.",J. Wilkes,US,87,42,Pinot Noir
103282,La Posta 2006 Cocina Blend Red (Mendoza),"“Cocina” means “the kitchen” in Spanish, and this blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah is definitely a kitchen-sink type of wine. It's stout, a bit reduced and tinny at first, but with air it turns into a nice, simple chunkster with plump baked-fruit flavors and a soft but structured chocolaty finish. Drink now.",La Posta,Argentina,87,15,Red Blend
103283,Leone de Castris 2005 Maiana Rosso Red (Salice Salentino),"Here's an easy-going Salice Salentino (90% Negroamaro and 10% Malvasia Nera) with spice, cherry and cola notes that are weaved nicely together. There's harmony and elegance here and the wine leaves a spicy imprint on the close.",Leone de Castris,Italy,87,10,Red Blend
103284,Mastroberardino 2007 Greco di Tufo,This neutral and mineral-driven Greco offers tones of white stone and dried flowers. The wine is lean and crisp with a thin but refreshing consistency. It would make an excellent companion to spicy Indian or Thai foods.,Mastroberardino,Italy,87,24,Greco
103285,Melipal 2006 Reserve Malbec (Mendoza),"Rubbery and smoky at first, with leather and berry fruit running secondary to the wine's more reduced qualities. But if given ten minutes to unwind, it shows wide black-fruit flavors, creaminess and finally some barrel-based resin. Gets better the more you work with it, but will always register as “oaky.”",Melipal,Argentina,87,46,Malbec
103286,Morrison Lane 2005 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This 2005 Syrah from Morrison Lane seems a bit lackluster compared with previous efforts. This is smoky and tight, a tannic wine with flavors of lead pencil, green tea and earth. But the fruit is quite light, tart, and does not seem to sync up with the heaviness of the tannins.",Morrison Lane,US,87,32,Syrah
103287,Morrison Lane 2006 Viognier (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Picked late and fermented on native yeast, this Viognier brings some snap and spice to its scents and flavors. The lime and quinine quality recalls a good gin and tonic; it definitely leans to the herbal rather than the tropical side of Viognier, but is crisp and refreshing.",Morrison Lane,US,87,23,Viognier
103288,Fazio 2005 Torre dei Venti Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),"Fazio makes the best of hot climate growing conditions and presents a well-composed Nero d'Avola that is enhanced by aromas of red apple, cassis, pomegranate and black cherry. There's good intensity here and some sweetness, although the mouthfeel is in no way heavy or thick.",Fazio,Italy,87,21,Nero d'Avola
103289,Gemtree 2006 Uncut Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"Smoky, cedary notes nicely complement the blueberry fruit in this McLaren Vale Shiraz. It's pretty full on the palate, with a slightly syrupy texture that extends the flavors through a mouthwatering finish. Drink now-2012.",Gemtree,Australia,87,24,Shiraz
103290,Adamant Cellars 2006 Spofford Station Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is 100% Syrah from an excellent vineyard. It's chewy and even a bit salty in the mouth, with a mix of bell pepper and black pepper over streaks of berry and cassis. Most of the flavor is front-loaded, and the wine fades away into an earthy, fairly tannic finish.",Adamant Cellars,US,87,35,Syrah
103291,Alberto Longo 2007 Le Fossette Falanghina (Puglia),"The bouquet here is very floral and intense: you'll get jasmine, honeysuckle, sweet apple, mango and other exotic fruits. The wine tastes clean, sweet and dense and has fragrant flavors that accompany you glass after glass.",Alberto Longo,Italy,87,18,Falanghina
103292,X 2006 ES Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),"Another super Sauvignon Blanc that shows how well Lake County does with this variety. It's all about the citrus, fig and spicy melon flavors and the juicy acidity, which makes the wine so fresh and clean. Made from the Musqué clone.",X,US,87,17,Sauvignon Blanc
103293,Godwin 2005 Floral Clone Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Enormous in jammy apricot, peach, pineapple, Asian spice and sweet charred oak vanillins, this Burgundy-inspired Chard is a little sweet. But it provides enough acidity for balanced structure.",Godwin,US,87,28,Chardonnay
103294,Hagafen 2006 Ripken Vineyard Roussanne (Lodi),"A fresh, intriguing wine whose balance and depth suggest midterm aging. Golden in color, it's succulent in the flavors of peaches, pineapples, limes, almond biscotti and butterscotch, with fine acidity and a rich, honeyed finish. Give it until sometime in 2008 and for another couple of years.",Hagafen,US,87,18,Roussanne
103295,Herdade da Malhadinha Nova 2006 Monte da Peceguina Red (Alentejano),"The second wine from Malhadinha Nova is lively and fruity, packed with red fruits, sweet strawberry flavors and easy, ripe texture. Drink now.",Herdade da Malhadinha Nova,Portugal,87,30,Portuguese Red
103296,Bucklin 2005 Old Hill Ranch Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"With the '05, Bucklin is getting a handle on this old-vine field blend of two dozen varieties, which seems to do best in cooler years. It's a rustic-chic wine, with a brawny muscularity tamed by extreme dryness, and even though the alcohol is 15.6%, it doesn't feel too hot.",Bucklin,US,87,34,Zinfandel
103297,Corley 2004 Proprietary Red Wine Red (Oak Knoll District),"Soft and fruity, this Bordeaux blend has a splash of Syrah. It's dry and grippy in tannins, and there's a dried herb edge to the blackberry fruit. Finishes polished and elegant, but the softness suggests early drinking.",Corley,US,87,55,Cabernet Blend
103298,DFJ Vinhos 2004 Tinta Roriz and Merlot Red (Estremadura),"An unexpected combination perhaps, but it works to give a fresh, flavorful wine, with soft tannins, juicy fruit and flavors of red cherries and vanilla. Not complex, and ready to drink now.",DFJ Vinhos,Portugal,87,11,Red Blend
103299,DFJ Vinhos 2006 Monte Alentejano White (Alentejano),"Fresh green-apple aromas and some ripe, mango flavors, this is well rounded, showing some acidity, but more of open, fresh fruits. This is a wine that will be perfect to drink over the next few months.",DFJ Vinhos,Portugal,87,,Portuguese White
103300,El Nido 2003 Clio Monastrell-Cabernet Sauvignon Red (Jumilla),"If all you're after is size, then sign on the dotted line. This blend is a monster that weighs in at 15.5%, so be ready for intensely sweet flavors of grape essence and licorice. To this judge, the wine has a lot of gumption but isn't what I'd want to drink glass after glass, day after day. It's lumbering, heavy but oh so sweet and dessert-like.",El Nido,Spain,87,42,Red Blend
103301,Backsberg 2005 Pinotage (Coastal Region),"The wines of Backsberg have a distinctive, artistic quality to them that makes them ideal for collectors and drinkers who seek wines with style. This Pinotage has those qualities, with its layers of cinnamon and deep berry on the nose and smooth, integrated berry and smoke flavors. This is a real Pinotage so expect the rubbery smoke that goes along with it—but it's also elegant, offering structure and complexity with a gentle touch.",Backsberg,South Africa,87,13,Pinotage
103302,Bonny Doon 2005 Le Cigar Blanc White (California),"The grapes were grown on the Central Coast, mostly in Arroyo Grande, and the wine is characterized by vibrant acidity. There is an intense taste of raspberries, more usually found in a red variety like Grenache than a white wine, but Grenache Blanc consitutes nearly half the blend, along with Roussanne.",Bonny Doon,US,87,20,White Blend
103303,Codorníu NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Cava),"This one takes on an orange tint, and the aromas are akin to chocolate, spice cake and even some baked beans. The palate is quite crisp and healthy, with berry fruit, citrus and length. A good wine with a racy, cleansing feel. It's not spectacular but it ranks highly among similar competitors.",Codorníu,Spain,87,15,Pinot Noir
103304,Conte Collalto NV Extra Dry (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene),"Thanks to its buoyant aromas of field flower, green apple, pear and dried sage leaf, you could definitely describe this as a multidimensional wine with noticeable elegance. There are musky, sweet fruit flavors on the finish.",Conte Collalto,Italy,87,19,Prosecco
103305,Schug 2006 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Schug's regular Pinot, as opposed to their Heritage Reserve, is a dependably village-style expression of easy-drinking, cool-climate Pinot Noir. The '06, like previous vintages, shows a silky, delicate texture framing cherry, raspberry and cola flavors, with a smoky vanilla edge of oak.",Schug,US,87,22,Pinot Noir
103306,St. Clement 2004 Star Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A first bottle was obviously off. A second was better, although still lacking the complexity you want at this price. It was a young Cab, dry and tannic, with a core of cassis and cherries. A few years in the cellar should soften it.",St. Clement,US,87,80,Cabernet Sauvignon
103307,Arbios 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"On a par with recent vintages, this four-year old Cab is soft and pleasant, with ripe cherry, blackberry, raspberry and herb flavors that are well oaked. The tannins are crunchy, but the wine isn't an ager. Best now through 2009.",Arbios,US,87,27,Cabernet Sauvignon
103308,Adami NV Vigneto Giardino Dry (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),"This is a dry Prosecco, meaning it is slightly sweeter than a brut or extra dry. Traditionally, Prosecco has this level of sugar, making it a very true rendition of what the wine is intended to taste like: Fresh peach, basil, pineapple, yellow apple and even an understated touch of banana come into play.",Adami,Italy,87,22,Prosecco
103309,Alentex 2006 Antão Vaz-Arinto White (Alentejo),"One of the principle grapes of the Alentejo, Antão Vaz blends easily with the Arinto of neighboring Ribatejo. There is an attractive citrus element to this wood-aged wine, soft, open, but remaining fresh, the tropical fruit flavors well under control.",Alentex,Portugal,87,,Portuguese White
103310,Bortolomiol 2005 Brut Millesimato Motus Vitae (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),"The idea here is to present a more structured and sophisticated Brut with emphasis on the nutty tones and mature peach. The wine succeeds in this regard but the whole point of Prosecco is to be light and fun; this ultimately lacks those sharp, well-defined fruit tones you might expect.",Bortolomiol,Italy,87,37,Prosecco
103311,Bortolotti NV Brut (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),"Here is a lighter, paler shade of Prosecco with opulent and cheerful soapy and herbal qualities (thanks to 10% Pinot Bianco) backed by lemon candy and polished mineral. Yellow apple and chalk are immediately recognizable. The mouthfeel is creamy and foamy with fresh crispness that is noticeable but not exaggerated.",Bortolotti,Italy,87,16,Prosecco
103312,Castle 2005 Sangiacomo Vineyards Pinot Noir (Carneros),"There's a sweetmeat, salty leatheriness to this Pinot, like beef jerky. Give it a year or so to mellow out and let the smoky oak integrate with the ripe cherry, cola and raspberry flavors. Decant for an hour or two if you pop it open now.",Castle,US,87,32,Pinot Noir
103313,Codorníu NV Reserva Raventós Brut Sparkling (Cava),"Ginger ale and Sprite are the first things that come to mind when you give it a sniff. The palate shows ripe and sweet orange, tangerine and pink grapefruit, while the back end is lean and citrusy but far short of complex. Good in a standard way.",Codorníu,Spain,87,15,Sparkling Blend
103314,Ortman Family 2008 Turner Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"A bit heavy handed, with lots of tannins and acidity, and the jammy cherry-berry fruit is in your face. It's made in a big, bold style that will appeal to fruit-forward fans.",Ortman Family,US,87,40,Pinot Noir
103315,Recanati 2009 Yasmin Kosher Red Red (Galilee),"Year after year, the Yasmin line from Recanati proves itself to be a fantastic value, and the 2009s are no exception. This 60% Merlot-40% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is fruit-driven but appropriately spiced with a lovely mocha-infused finish. The silky texture offers approachable, dusty tannins integrated throughout the medium-weight mouth.",Recanati,Israel,87,11,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
103316,Tenuta di Vignole 2007 Chianti Classico,"Perfect for a pairing with lasagna or meat cannelloni with bechamel sauce, this bright Chianti Classico has the natural acidity to cut though fatty food ingredients. The wine's aromas recall white cherry and raspberry.",Tenuta di Vignole,Italy,87,,Sangiovese
103317,Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.",Two Vintners,US,87,25,Red Blend
103318,X 2009 Truchard Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Teeters on the verge of complexity, with dry, spicy flavors of raspberries and cherries. Good Carneros acidity makes for a brisk mouthfeel. Should develop for a year or three in the bottle.",X,US,87,27,Pinot Noir
103319,Albet I Noya 2009 Petit Albet White (Penedès),"Minerally, dry and clean white wine made from 60% Xarello and 40% Chardonnay. The nose is peachy, while the palate is spritzy and bouncy, with short, slightly creamy apple, melon and papaya flavors that are true to Xarello. Finishes smooth but a little flat.",Albet I Noya,Spain,87,13,White Blend
103320,Avignonesi 2008 Rosso di Montepulciano,"Avignonesi takes a traditionalists' approach to most of its wines, including this ruby-colored Rosso di Montepulciano. Slightly muddled aromas of cherry and dried raspberry mingle with tobacco, leather and spice.",Avignonesi,Italy,87,19,Prugnolo Gentile
103321,Binyamina 2009 Reserve Unoaked Kosher Chardonnay (Judean Hills),"Here's a fresh and lively unoaked Chard that's perfect for lighter fare like tabouleh salad or grilled chicken. Green apple and citrus mingle with a hint of lemon custard on the nose, while the medium-weight mouth offers more green plum and white nectarine flavors. Flavorful and refreshing; drink now.",Binyamina,Israel,87,20,Chardonnay
103322,Valserrano 2004 Rioja,"A snappy, high-acid wine that pulses with red fruit aromas and flavors. It's sheering, which is normal for the Graciano variety, but it also tastes nice while delivering a bolt of raspberry and red plum flavor. Oak comes up late, providing a counterweight of vanilla and dry spice. Nice but like all varietal Gracianos, it's sharp and limited.",Valserrano,Spain,87,45,Graciano
103323,Mt. Beautiful 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Canterbury),"A plump, nicely concentrated Sauvignon Blanc, the 2009 Mount Beautiful doesn't have the most intense aromatics, but is holding on to its weighty melon and fig flavors and lingering citrus finish. Drink up.",Mt. Beautiful,New Zealand,87,20,Sauvignon Blanc
103324,Poggio Nardone 2008 Morellino di Scansano,"Sangiovese is enhanced by small percentages of Malvasia Nera and Colorino to deliver a plush, plump and satisfying Morellino from southern Tuscany. There's a nice feeling of informality here that makes this wine perfect for easy meals with family and friends.",Poggio Nardone,Italy,87,,Sangiovese
103325,Château Ramafort 2008 Médoc,"At first taste, the tannins dominate. Then fresher fruit shows through. The wine is firmly dry, the texture linear, the fruit showing some black currant character.",Château Ramafort,France,87,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
103326,Mana 2008 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),"Slightly more concentrated than other Marlborough Pinots in this price range, the 2008 Mana displays modest cherry fruit and an array of savory elements, including game, brine and peppery spice. It's a bit rough around the edges, yet in a charming sort of way. Drink now–2012.",Mana,New Zealand,87,17,Pinot Noir
103327,Drew 2009 Morning Dew Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Acidity marks this fresh, young Pinot Noir. It's as if the raspberry and cherry wine has been enlivened with a splash or three of lime juice. This primary fruit tartness may be because the wine was bottled and rushed to market too early. Don't drink it now. Give it a year or two to integrate.",Drew,US,87,47,Pinot Noir
103328,Giuliano Tiberi 2007 Le Vespe Sangiovese (Toscana),"Clove and dark Indian spice is the protagonist here and background aromas of cherry and moist earth play supporting roles. The wine is smooth and soft in the mouth with a bright, zesty close.",Giuliano Tiberi,Italy,87,,Sangiovese
103329,Greater Purpose NV White Label Red (Dry Creek Valley),"Made from an unknown blend of grapes, this nonvintage red is good, dry and versatile. It has juicy flavors of blackberries and pepper, with some extra layers of depth that make it a good value for a restaurant by-the-glass wine.",Greater Purpose,US,87,18,Red Blend
103330,Reina de Castilla 2009 Isabelino Verdejo-Viura (Rueda),"Maybe it's the Viura, becuase this $9 wine seems cleaner, rounder and slightly better than the winery's higher-priced pure Verdejos. Look for generic but fresh peach and citrus aromas and then lip-smacking citrus flavors. Finishes composed and clean, with lasting grapefruit flavor. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura.",Reina de Castilla,Spain,87,9,Verdejo-Viura
103331,Rocca delle Macìe 2007 Chianti Classico,"This is a classic interpretation of Chianti Classico with bright aromas of small berry fruit, raspberry and blue flower. But there's also a modern touch as well that comes off aromatically as spice and new leather.",Rocca delle Macìe,Italy,87,16,Sangiovese
103332,Joseph Drouhin 2012 Pouilly-Fuissé,"This wine is missing great depth of flavor. It has bright acidity and hints of peach fruit flavors, but remains dull.",Joseph Drouhin,France,84,29,Chardonnay
103333,Vino Vargas 2013 Olé Chardonnay (Central Coast),"There's pineapple and sharp dill on the nose of this wine from a Gilroy-based producer. Once sipped, apple cider and a tinge of petrol flavors emerge.",Vino Vargas,US,84,24,Chardonnay
103334,Demessey 2012 Château de Messey Les Crets (Mâcon-Chardonnay),"This is a generous, rounded and very perfumed wine. Candy and bubble gum flavors give sweetness that contrasts with the acidity.",Demessey,France,84,23,Chardonnay
103335,Four Degrees of Riesling 2012 0 Degree Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake),"Faithful to its label, this zero-degree residual-sugar Riesling is stark, steely and intensely dry. Bracing lemon acidity and tart green-apple flavors lend a tight, unyielding feel to the palate, but it's a refreshing accompaniment to creamy pasta or chicken dishes. Drink now.",Four Degrees of Riesling,US,84,16,Riesling
103336,Joseph Drouhin 2011 Chorey-lès-Beaune,"The wine is tight, green and herbal. It has some fruitiness, but that is suppressed by general underripeness. The tannins are hard at the end.",Joseph Drouhin,France,84,28,Pinot Noir
103337,Knapp 2013 Dry Rosé (Finger Lakes),"Dusty mineral and earth tones lend a savory feel to delicate cherry and red-plum flavors in this pale pink rosé. Bright, fresh raspberry-lemonade acidity bristles on the palate.",Knapp,US,84,13,Rosé
103338,Armosa 2008 Curma Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),"Funky aromas of farmyard, tire rubber and fetid flowers waft from the glass of this Nero d'Avola. The muddled palate offers stewed prune, overripe black plum and oaky vanilla alongside bitter, green sensations of old sage. Panebianco, Vinity.",Armosa,Italy,84,35,Nero d'Avola
103339,Fulkerson 2012 William Vigne Grüner Veltliner (Seneca Lake),"Aromas of pressed apple and pear are savory and earthy on this brisk, medium-bodied Grüner Veltliner. There's a dusty minerality that lingers through the midpalate, but the finish is bright and lemony.",Fulkerson,US,84,14,Grüner Veltliner
103340,Stomping Ground 2012 Chardonnay (California),"Pleasant and fruity to sip, soft in texture, light- to medium bodied, it has a rich yellow-gold color, butter-candy aromas, ripe apple flavors and a slightly sweet finish.",Stomping Ground,US,84,10,Chardonnay
103341,L. Tramier & Fils 2012 Linteau Red (Côtes du Rhône),"This blend of 70% Grenache and 30% Syrah is a chunky, slightly rustic style of Côtes-du-Rhône. It starts off with tar and herb aromas, then turns plummy and chocolaty on the palate. Drink now–2017.",L. Tramier & Fils,France,84,13,Rhône-style Red Blend
103342,Lo Nuevo 2012 Covello Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Peach and apple aromas are fruity but not precise or minerally. This has peachy acidity but a wide, unfocused palate. Flavors of peach and nectarine are tasty but lack the crispness that Albariño is known for.",Lo Nuevo,Spain,84,15,Albariño
103343,Pierre André 2011 Ladoix,"This tight wine has red fruit acidity without the richness. With its green edge, it's likely to remain full of acidity even as it matures.",Pierre André,France,84,29,Pinot Noir
103344,Suvla 2012 Kinali Yapincak (Thrace),"Made of Kinali Yapincak, a grape native to Turkey, this deep-straw colored wine does not give up much on the nose beyond a touch of apricot and just-washed cotton sheets. It does not seem wholly integrated on the palate, with chewy tannins overpowering flavors of melon, toast and white flower.",Suvla,Turkey,84,15,Kinali Yapincak
103345,Swedish Hill 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Pressed apple notes are touched with butter and creamed corn on this savory-style Chardonnay. It's rich and full on the palate with a satisfying silkiness that's brightened with lemony acidity.,Swedish Hill,US,84,17,Chardonnay
103346,Chanson Père et Fils 2012 Viré-Clessé,"The green fruit flavors dominate this very fresh, crisp wine. It has acidity as much as fruitiness, giving a steely, tight character. Drink now.",Chanson Père et Fils,France,84,,Chardonnay
103347,Coto de Hayas 2013 Chardonnay (Campo de Borja),Mild aromas of apple and generic white fruits are friendly enough. This has a monotone citrusy mouthfeel and flavors of tangerine and grapefruit. A bit of stalky corn and hay flavor rises up on the finish.,Coto de Hayas,Spain,84,9,Chardonnay
103348,Demessey 2011 Les Hâtes (Santenay),"A firm wine that is mainly tannin without a great fruit element. It is dry, tight and hard-edged.",Demessey,France,84,40,Pinot Noir
103349,Jean-Marie Challand 2012 Vieilles Vignes (Viré-Clessé),"Tropical in character, this wine has soft acidity and an attractive texture. With ripe mango flavor, it's full in the mouth and ready to drink.",Jean-Marie Challand,France,84,30,Chardonnay
103350,Domaine Sophie Cinier 2012 Mâcon-Fuissé,"Burnt caramel aromas give a wine that has weight, sweetness and packs in the vanilla. It misses out on real fruitiness, giving weight rather than freshness.",Domaine Sophie Cinier,France,84,,Chardonnay
103351,Fazeli Cellars 2009 Khayyam Cabernet Sauvignon (Temecula Valley),"Complicated, at times confusingly dank aromas of mushrooms, hops, dill and other wet herbs emerge from this bottling. Those atypical varietal characters find their way onto the palate as well, with olive and stewed mushrooms leading the way.",Fazeli Cellars,US,84,50,Cabernet Sauvignon
103352,Four Degrees of Riesling 2012 2nd Degree Medium Sweet Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Lush and tropical with rich, ripe streaks of pineapple and mango, this medium-sweet Riesling is unabashedly forward and fruity, but hints of earth and dust on the midpalate lend a dark tone. Light on its feet, with a lemony finish.",Four Degrees of Riesling,US,84,14,Riesling
103353,Pierre André 2012 Saint-Véran,"Tight, acidic and very crisp, it's propelled forward by lemon zest and grapefruit flavors. It is bright, fruity and light in texture.",Pierre André,France,84,20,Chardonnay

103355,Joseph Burrier 2012 Château de Beauregard (Saint-Véran),"A vegetal wine that has acidity and rhubarb flavors. It is tight and full of acidity, with a very citrusy aftertaste. Drink now.",Joseph Burrier,France,84,,Chardonnay
103356,King's Garden Vineyards 2010 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"While pulpy and ripe on the nose with aromas of blackberry and cherry compote, this Cabernet Franc runs towards the savory side on the palate. Bold in body and alcohol, it's rich with red fruit, but has a musty, earthen tone that persists through the finish.",King's Garden Vineyards,US,84,18,Cabernet Franc
103357,Laird 2011 Jillian's Blend Red (Napa Valley),"Dusty in tannins and planky in wood, this chewy red blends Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and Malbec into a mouthful of black olive, black currant and leather.",Laird,US,84,44,Red Blend
103358,McGregor 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),"Scents of fresh red cherries and bramble wood entice on the nose of this aromatic, spice-toned Cabernet Sauvignon. The palate, while crisp with cranberry acidity, is a bit subdued with subtle red-fruit flavor and a finish that wraps up short and tight.",McGregor,US,84,30,Cabernet Sauvignon
103359,Bodegas Valdemar 2010 Conde de Valdemar Old Vines (Rioja),"Raisiny, pruny aromas are all that register on this rubbery, jammy Garnacha. Flavors of sweet plum, raspberry and raisin are chunky, while the finish is raisiny in flavor and rubbery in feel.",Bodegas Valdemar,Spain,84,15,Garnacha
103360,Protos 2011 Reserva (Ribera del Duero),"Gritty, intense, oaky and powerful from start to finish, this displays black-fruit aromas, hints of asphalt and an intense mouthfeel with a tight grip. A common duo of black-fruit and oaky flavors finishes with vanilla notes and a hint of coconut. Drink this structured, fully tannic RDD through 2028.",Protos,Spain,92,50,Tempranillo
103361,Schloss Vollrads 2015 Spätlese Riesling (Rheingau),"Electric lemon-lime acidity reverberates throughout this light-bodied Riesling.

103362,Sojourn 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"This hails from a 1,000–1,400-foot elevation site above the valley floor called Oakville Ranch that contributes beautiful power in its firm, integrated tannin and oak.

103363,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2013 Cask 23 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a rich, peppery and generously tannic and full-bodied expression of the grape, both powerful and brimming in grace. Soft and mellow on the midpalate, it builds up ripeness and texture toward the finish, ending with a satisfying bite of graham cracker and chocolate.",Stag's Leap Wine Cellars,US,92,260,Cabernet Sauvignon
103364,Thorn Clarke 2014 Eden Trail Riesling (Eden Valley),"Lean, tight and austere, this textbook Eden Valley Riesling should develop well over the next 5–8 years, reaching maturity around 2022. Scents of petrichor and tangerine ease into tart lemon-lime notes on the palate, ending tart and mouthpuckering.",Thorn Clarke,Australia,92,18,Riesling
103365,Aratás 2011 Shake Ridge Ranch Petite Sirah (Amador County),"This full-bodied wine has a big impact on the palate due to smoky, meaty flavors, very firm tannins and an overall huge personality. It starts with aromas of charcoal and charred oak, goes to ripe, rich but not sweet fruit flavors, and finishes with all that grip as well as lingering smoky nuances.",Aratás,US,92,45,Petite Sirah
103366,Santos & Seixo 2013 Santos da Casa Grande Reserva Red (Douro),"This wine has fine tannins, ripe berry fruits and well-integrated acidity.

103367,Spicy Vines 2014 Joie de Vivre Chardonnay (Mendocino Ridge),"Subtle, well-balanced and rich in texture, this full-bodied wine sneaks up on the taste buds, starting with mild Bosc pear and toasted-almond aromas, then pouring richer pear, honey and hazelnut flavors onto the palate. A slight reserve in the flavors is more than offset by a quiet complexity and lingering finish.",Spicy Vines,US,92,38,Chardonnay
103368,Terra d'Oro 2014 Teroldego (Amador County),"Super-concentrated and intense, this starts with a very deep color and aromas like espresso and smoked meat.

103370,Tongue Dancer 2014 Putnam Vineyard Pinot de Ville Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"In this inaugural release, winemaker James MacPhail travels to the far reaches of Annapolis to source grapes from the true wilderness, the site next door to Goldrock Ridge Vineyard. Made in a full-bodied style, this wine is intriguing in dried herb, black pepper and forest floor, with a healthy, lengthy seasoning of savory black tea.",Tongue Dancer,US,92,65,Pinot Noir
103371,Uvaggio 2015 Secco Moscato (Lodi),"This bone-dry and floral wine will taste great with simple appetizers like toasted nuts or fresh cheeses. It is very well concentrated and has medium to full body. An opulent texture helps carry the floral, appley, grapefruity flavors into the finish.",Uvaggio,US,92,16,Moscato
103372,WillaKenzie Estate 2014 Triple Black Slopes Pinot Noir,"A slightly bitter tobacco note frames black-cherry fruit. The tannins need more time to smooth out, and that bitter streak is a bit worrisome. But that said, this powerful deep compact wine may explode with flavor if you have the patience to cellar it. Drink after 2020.",WillaKenzie Estate,US,92,75,Pinot Noir
103373,WillaKenzie Estate 2015 Estate Grown Pinot Blanc,"This thoroughly delightful wine puts a polished sheen on this grape, that is so often lost in the shuffle between Pinot Gris and Chardonnay.

103376,Avennia 2014 Arnaut Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Coming from one of the state's most esteemed Syrah vineyards, this wine wins over fans by its brains rather than its brawn.

103378,Brian Carter Cellars 2012 Solesce Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The winery's flagship wine, Cabernet Sauvignon makes up just over half, with the balance Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc.

103382,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler 2015 Bernkasteler Badstube Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"Dusty minerals, pollen and spice notes lend complexity to this honey-toned auslese.

103385,Ovum 2015 Memorista Tradition Riesling (Eola-Amity Hills),"From a different block of the same vineyard as the “Whale label” Memorista, this is drinking much better at the moment.

Drink from 2020.",Ramos-Pinto,Portugal,92,31,Portuguese Red
103390,Wyncroft 2013 Wren Song Riesling (Lake Michigan Shore),"Lemon pith and ripe peach aromas are clouded under a distinctly medicinal tone of baby aspirin. While there is nice roundness to the palate and balanced acidity to boot, the flavors are mild showings of orchard fruit and lemon curd.",Wyncroft,US,84,25,Riesling
103391,Vicente Gandia 2014 Hoya de Cadenas Organic Verdejo (Spain),"Lightly floral aromas are dilute while hinting at quince jelly. There's not a lot of vitality to the palate, while tangerine and nectarine flavors are watery. Pithy citrus notes carry the finish before it putters out.",Vicente Gandia,Spain,84,9,Verdejo
103392,Casa Montes 2014 Ampakama Chardonnay (San Juan),"Tropical aromas revolve around lemon-lime. This is acidic without much body. Flavors of lemon, melon, mango and green apple are lean and finish with tangy, pithy citrus flavors.",Casa Montes,Argentina,84,11,Chardonnay
103393,Albet I Noya 2014 XA Xarel-lo (Penedès),"Bland aromas suggest applesauce. This varietal Xarello feels plump but flat. Candied, generic white-fruit flavors are nonspecific, while this offers up citrus notes and pyrazines on the finish.",Albet I Noya,Spain,84,14,Xarel-lo
103394,Gustafson Family 2012 Mountain Cuvée Estate Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"From the producer's Old Vineyard Block, and blended with 20% Petite Sirah and 5% Syrah, this wine has a rustic barnyardy quality. It offers a tightness of dried herb around broad, sweet tannins, strawberry jam and chocolate.",Gustafson Family,US,84,24,Zinfandel
103395,JAQK Cellars 2013 High Roller Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Meant to provide value, this wine also offers big oak, smoke and a bittersweet taste of black-tea tannins. Shy in fruit, this has a slightly reduced effect on the finish.",JAQK Cellars,US,84,20,Pinot Noir
103396,Gracianna 2014 Suzanne's Blend Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Apple skin and guava rise out from a more buttery aroma that leads to oak on the palate. Light bodied, the wine finishes tart in lemon and lime.",Gracianna,US,84,36,Chardonnay
103397,Angulo Innocenti 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (La Consulta),"Leafy, green aromas suggest eucalyptus and a briar patch. A lean palate offers aroma-matching flavors of green herbs along with plum, cherry and clay notes. This is oaky and resiny tasting on the finish, and hot as well.",Angulo Innocenti,Argentina,84,20,Cabernet Sauvignon
103398,Cable Car 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"This is on the light side, with simple flavors and a juicy, soft texture that shows very little tannin. Aromas and flavors recall cherries and strawberries.",Cable Car,US,84,13,Cabernet Sauvignon
103399,Michael-Scott 2013 Zinfandel (Napa County-Sonoma County),"Pruney and somewhat reduced, this thick offering of chocolate and blackberry jam needs food to mellow it out, preferably meat covered thickly in sauce.",Michael-Scott,US,84,32,Zinfandel
103400,Luis Segundo Correas 2013 Valle Las Acequias Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Wiry, briary currant and herbal aromas announce a hard but juicy wine with buttery oak, salty red fruit flavors and a loud herbal angle. This is both briny tasting and a touch weedy on the finish.",Luis Segundo Correas,Argentina,84,15,Cabernet Sauvignon
103401,Parras Vinhos 2014 Montaria Tinto Red (Alentejano),"This is a rich, full wine that has red fruits and soft tannins. With balanced acidity, only a hint of tannins, it is ready to drink.",Parras Vinhos,Portugal,84,8,Portuguese Red
103402,Quinta do Casal Branco 2014 Quartilho Branco White (Tejo),"This is a gentle, ripe wine that has pineapple and peach flavors and fresh fruitiness. It is smooth with balanced acidity and a zesty aftertaste. Drink now.",Quinta do Casal Branco,Portugal,84,13,Portuguese White
103403,Quinta do Casal Monteiro 2015 White (Tejo),"A young, fresh blend of Arinto and Fernão Pires, the wine is fruity, light and with a crisp, bright aftertaste. Drink now.",Quinta do Casal Monteiro,Portugal,84,10,Portuguese White
103404,Schmidt 2012 Pinot Noir (Applegate Valley),"Somewhat disjointed flavors mix subtle red fruits with cracker, licorice and coffee. So far the components have not smoothed out. It's a flavor jumble.",Schmidt,US,84,40,Pinot Noir
103405,Three Fires 2013 Unoaked Chardonnay (Lake Michigan Shore),Faint notes of yuzu rise over underripe peach in this unoaked Chardonnay. The light-bodied palate shows a mild concentration of lemon leading to a short but clean finish.,Three Fires,US,84,32,Chardonnay
103406,Verterra 2014 Dry Gewurztraminer (Leelanau Peninsula),"Muddled aromas of tangerine, grapefruit and papaya seem a bit soapy in character. The palate feels a bit underripe, showing milky florals upfront and unconcentrated citrus on the back.",Verterra,US,84,18,Gewürztraminer
103407,Wine with Spirit 2013 Bastardo! Black Edition Tinto Red (Tejo),"The wine is fresh with red berry flavors and a stalky tannic core. It's lightly perfumed, light in texture and ready to drink.",Wine with Spirit,Portugal,84,25,Portuguese Red

103409,Finca Salazar 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),Oily aromas of orange peel are inoffensive. A shearing palate offers little textural pleasure or complexity. Flavors of lemon and blood orange finish with a sour note of underripe pineapple.,Finca Salazar,Spain,83,11,Sauvignon Blanc
103410,Buena Vista 2013 Private Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"This somewhat indistinctive wine has a wealth of minty aroma on the nose, a characteristic that doesn't shake off on the palate, the body full and a touch hot.",Buena Vista,US,83,40,Zinfandel
103411,Pazo de Barrantes 2012 La Comtesse Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Yeasty aromas are devoid of fruit, commitment and minerality, and instead smell oddly floral and unconvincing. A waxy, wan palate and oaky flavors of clove finish with resiny, pushy spice notes. This tastes overly oaky and resiny, like the winery's Rioja white called La Capellanía but without the goods.",Pazo de Barrantes,Spain,83,60,Albariño
103412,Cooperativa Reguengos de Monsaraz 2014 Monsaraz Branco White (Alentejo),"The wine is fruity, although with a yeasty character that leaves a bready taste. It has acidity, ripe yellow fruits and the fruitiness may come to dominate although that is not certain.",Cooperativa Reguengos de Monsaraz,Portugal,83,9,Portuguese White
103413,Armanino Family Cellars 2013 The Pintail Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"There's something mushroomy and feral about this wine, which finishes with sour cherry.",Armanino Family Cellars,US,83,55,Pinot Noir
103414,Parras Vinhos 2014 Castelo do Sulco Colheita White (Lisboa),"A blend of Moscatel and Arinto, this is light and thin with only the vaguest hint of citrus fruit acidity. It should be drunk now.",Parras Vinhos,Portugal,83,8,Portuguese White
103415,Lechthaler 2014 Drago Pinot Grigio (Trentino),"The nose isn't very expressive but you can detect whiffs of adhesive bandage, medicinal herb, apple skin and mineral that carry over to the diluted, rather bitter palate. Brisk acidity underscores the wine's lean character.",Lechthaler,Italy,83,16,Pinot Grigio
103416,Coast 2013 Chardonnay (California),"While very flavorful, this wine is more of a dessert drink than a lunch or dinner wine. It smells sweet and earthy, feels unctous and tastes sweet, especially on the finish.",Coast,US,83,9,Chardonnay
103417,Pagos del Rey 2014 Altos de Tamaron (Ribera del Duero),"Candied raspberry aromas and a racy, acidic, crisp feel tell you what's coming: pie-cherry tartness and then a sizzle-and-pop finish that's fresh but astringent.",Pagos del Rey,Spain,83,11,Tempranillo
103418,Pat Paulsen Vineyards 2013 England-Shaw Vienyard Syrah (Solano County),"Balsamic aromas and strong pruney flavors combine for a heavy-handed taste in this full-bodied wine. It seems to be well-aged already, so drink it soon if you like this style.",Pat Paulsen Vineyards,US,83,24,Syrah
103419,Mossback 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Earthy and stemmy in dark black fruit, this wine contains 2% Syrah from Dunnigan Hills, though it's unclear how that contributes. Thin on the palate, it has a medicinal, minty flourish on the finish.",Mossback,US,83,25,Pinot Noir
103420,Peachy Canyon 2012 Especial Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Aromas of blueberries, beef roast and fudge give way to a light, straightforward palate of purple fruit. It's a clean wine, but not very complex.",Peachy Canyon,US,86,40,Zinfandel
103421,Quinta de Porrais 2012 Porrais Red (Douro),Rustic aromas are followed by rough-edged fruitiness in this young wine. It has ripe berry fruits as well as some firm tannins in the background. It is not yet integrated and needs to develop much more. Drink from 2018.,Quinta de Porrais,Portugal,86,15,Portuguese Red
103422,Quintas de Melgaço 2014 QM Terra Antiga White (Vinho Verde),"This light, bright wine comes from the north of the Vinho Verde region. It has freshly squeezed lemon juice with a touch of lime zest as well as spice. The lightest prickle on the tongue gives the wine a final lift.",Quintas de Melgaço,Portugal,86,,Portuguese White
103423,Tricky Rabbit 2012 Reserva Cabernet Franc-Carmenère (Maule Valley),"Chunky, slightly jammy plum and blackberry aromas are good but basic. In the mouth, this shows tartaric grit and bite along with lean fruit. Flavors of red plum and raspberry finish zesty but with hardly any complexity.",Tricky Rabbit,Chile,86,12,Cabernet Franc-Carmenère
103424,Bradford Mountain 2012 Grist Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"This wine also contains 25% Zinfandel and is wildly savage in herb, baked plum jam, tobacco and a strong arm of oak. Midpalate, it takes on more savory peppercorn and herb over fruit, finishing mildly.",Bradford Mountain,US,86,32,Syrah
103425,Consilience 2012 Petite Sirah (Santa Barbara County),"There's a slightly reductive quality on the nose of this wine, with rubber, tar, dill and hot lava rock notes. The palate shows roast beef char, sour cherry fruits and asphalt.",Consilience,US,86,26,Petite Sirah
103426,Domaine de la Pepière 2009 Cuvée 3 (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),"A blend of two different vineyards, this ripe wine is now very mature. It has lost its primary fruitiness and developed toasty spice as well as a more funky, earthy character.",Domaine de la Pepière,France,86,20,Melon
103427,Falua 2013 Tagus Creek Tinto Red (Alentejano),"In this blend of Shiraz and Trincadeira, both grapes contribute red fruits, soft tannins and fresh-faced acidity. With no complications—just bright, juicy fruit—the wine is ready to drink.",Falua,Portugal,86,12,Portuguese Red
103428,Quinta da Rede 2013 Rede Branco White (Douro),"Both mineral and herbaceous, this is a crisp, taut and textured wine. It shows a tangy character, lemon zest and bright acidity. It's still too young, so drink from the end of 2015.",Quinta da Rede,Portugal,86,11,Portuguese White
103429,Reustle 2013 Winemaker's Reserve Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"Similar to the winery's regular Pinot Noir, this is moving quickly along the aging curve. Hints of strawberry fruit are cloaked in barrel flavors of mocha and cracker. Drink soon.",Reustle,US,86,39,Pinot Noir
103430,Silverado 2011 Estate Grown Mt. George Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"Red plum compote is at the center of this wine, a 100% varietal, with hearty bursts of herb and green pepper, as well as savory spice. From the cooler Coombsville appellation, it is soft, round and on the paler, thinner side of Napa's ripeness spectrum, more restrained.",Silverado,US,86,35,Merlot
103431,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2013 Aveta Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"The inaugural vintage of this wine, named for a water goddess, this offers herb, grass, lemon and peach around a medium body influenced by some oak. As it develops in the glass, tropical fruit unfurls in a refreshing spritz before settling down to a tart finish.",Stag's Leap Wine Cellars,US,86,26,Sauvignon Blanc
103432,Yohan Lardy 2015 Les Michelons (Moulin-à-Vent),"The wine is still young with its crisp red fruits and tense tannins. It is a structured wine, firm with a dry core and still developing its fruitiness. It will need to age a while yet, so drink from 2018.",Yohan Lardy,France,88,25,Gamay
103433,Analemma 2014 Atavus Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"The aromas are light, with notes of freshly cut apple and spice. It drinks dry with elegantly styled fruit flavors that linger on the finish. It shows a very pretty styling.",Analemma,US,88,27,Gewürztraminer
103434,Argyle 2014 Nuthouse Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Light strawberry fruit with tart acidity carries a wine of modest proportions. It's drinking well, and might be a good choice for a simple salmon preparation, as it would not overwhelm the fish. The finishing tannins have a definite herbal flavor.",Argyle,US,88,50,Pinot Noir
103435,Chopo 2014 Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla),"Jammy plum and berry aromas come with dessert herb scents. A juicy palate doesn't offer much structure, but this Monastrell-Syrah blend tastes good courtesy of plum, blackberry and toasty flavors.

103436,Meyer Family Cellars 2013 Syrah (Yorkville Highlands),"Smooth and polished, this medium-bodied wine has attractive fruit and cinnamon aromas, generous dark-fruit flavors, and light touches of baking spices.",Meyer Family Cellars,US,88,28,Syrah
103437,Milbrandt 2012 Vineyard Series Clifton Vineyards Grenache (Wahluke Slope),Aromas of vanilla and cocoa mix with red fruit. The fruit flavors are full and palate coating but the oak seems a little too intense at times.,Milbrandt,US,88,28,Grenache
103438,MooBuzz 2015 G-S-M (Central Coast),"Hibiscus and strawberry scents make an appealing invitation on the nose of this bottling, and then light cola and pepper spice up the ante. This would be a great red for warmer weather, served with a slight chill that would still allow the flavors of sandalwood, red cherry and marjoram to emerge.",MooBuzz,US,88,22,G-S-M
103439,Opolo 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Though a reserve bottling, this shows a very fresh and sprightly side of the grape rather than its dense face. Squeezed blackberries, just-picked thyme and a touch of burnt caramel show on the nose, while the palate offers Concord grape, boysenberry and iced-coffee flavors.",Opolo,US,88,55,Cabernet Sauvignon
103440,Palma Real 2015 Verdejo-Viura (Rueda),"Melon, nectarine and mild citrus aromas are clean and direct. This basic white is firm and balanced, while stone fruit, melon and white-pepper flavors end easy and fresh.",Palma Real,Spain,88,10,Verdejo-Viura
103441,Parras Wines 2015 Evidência Red (Dão),"This structured wine has a strong mineral element. With black-currant and berry flavors, it is firm and still young. Swathes of rich fruit are sustained by solid tannins. Drink from late 2017.",Parras Wines,Portugal,88,,Portuguese Red
103442,Proulx 2014 The Wah Syrah (Paso Robles),"Candied black cherry and fresh boysenberry aromas meet with darker touches of soy, teriyaki and burnt caramel on the nose of this bottling. The palate is mineral-driven, with light tar, asphalt and peppercorn flavors leading into dusty elderberry fruit.",Proulx,US,88,72,Syrah
103443,Quinta do Vale Meão 2014 Meandro do Vale Meão Red (Douro),"The second wine of Vale Meão, this is rich and fruity. It has enough structure to allow it to develop while also having plenty of red-berry fruits and soft tannins. Give this wine until 2019.",Quinta do Vale Meão,Portugal,88,20,Portuguese Red
103444,Quinta Dona Matilde 2013 Dona Matilde Reserva Red (Douro),Red-berry fruits and soft tannins give a wine with some juicy acidity and spice. The firm aftertaste shows that it is still needs time. Drink from 2018.,Quinta Dona Matilde,Portugal,88,39,Portuguese Red
103445,Quinta dos Poços 2013 Reserva Red (Douro),Spice from wood aging is the initial character of this wine. Then the fruit comes through more strongly to give the wine richness and structure. Drink from 2018.,Quinta dos Poços,Portugal,88,19,Portuguese Red
103446,Robert Mondavi 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Aromatics of rose and mint give this wine prettiness on the nose before getting into darker, richer components on the palate. Medium in build, it retains a sizable tannin presence in its youth, complemented by dark cherry and a char on the oak.",Robert Mondavi,US,88,60,Pinot Noir
103447,Roco 2014 Gravel Road Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A mix of clones and vineyard sources, this is a bit rough and tumble, as the name might suggest. Hard cherry candy carries a touch of rubber, and some rugged tannins. That said, it's got plenty of punch and power.",Roco,US,88,30,Pinot Noir
103448,Tenuta Duecorti 2012 Castelletto (Barolo),"Earthy nose of dried underbrush, truffle and scorched soil give way to cranberry and sour cherry flavors. Dried herb and dark spice add some depth while tightly packed astringent tannins leave a mouth-puckering finish. It's rather straightforward but let the tannins relax for another few years then drink.",Tenuta Duecorti,Italy,88,70,Nebbiolo
103449,Podere ai Valloni 2014 Gratus Bio Red (Colline Novaresi),"A blend of 85% Nebbiolo and 15% Uva Rara, this fragrant red boasts alluring scents of pressed rose, moist earth, aromatic herb and whiff of exotic spice.

103450,Jamieson Ranch 2014 Whiplash Malbec (California),"This is a very good, medium-bodied wine. It has lightly oaky aromas, lots of fruit flavor, a smooth texture and an almost-sweet finish.",Jamieson Ranch,US,88,16,Malbec

103453,Zolo 2015 Sustainably Farmed Estate Grown and Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Cola, plum and red-currant aromas set up a tight palate with clamping tannins. Flavors of black cherry, cassis, plum and chocolate are lasting across the finish. This needs hearty food, additional airing or both to show its best.",Zolo,Argentina,88,12,Cabernet Sauvignon
103454,Greystone Cellars 2014 Petite Sirah (California),"Heady aromas like wood smoke, black pepper and new rubber tire lead to equally peppery, smoky flavors and a firm, nicely tannic texture. The wine is medium to full bodied and well concentrated.",Greystone Cellars,US,88,14,Petite Sirah
103455,Hill-Smith Estate 2014 Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills),"This hand-picked, wild-fermented Chardonnay offers a lot to like.

103456,Balletto 2015 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"From a relatively cool site for the variety, this white shows an abundance of green olive and Meyer lemon. Moderate body and acidity allow for a touch of lemongrass spiciness and black licorice amid the textured mouthfeel and length.",Balletto,US,88,19,Sauvignon Blanc
103457,Cadus 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Agrelo),"Aromas of prune, blackberry, lemon peel and shoe polish are dark and earthy. This feels full and chewy, with hard tannins. Dark toasty black-fruit flavors come with herbal notes and wood spice flavors, while this tastes herbal, oaky, minty and like clove on the finish.",Cadus,Argentina,88,20,Cabernet Sauvignon
103458,Cadus 2014 Gualtallary Malbec (Mendoza),"Odd aromas of curried meat and iodine are more unusual than off-putting. This feels a bit wide and heavy, with flatness to the palate. Flavors of roasted plum and savory spices suggest lamb curry, while this feels robust and aggressive on a slightly hot finish.",Cadus,Argentina,88,20,Malbec
103459,Casto Oaks 2014 Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"This very focused wine is deeply colored, has smoky, meaty aromas and concentrated fruit flavors. It is full bodied, firm and moderately tannic in texture.",Casto Oaks,US,88,15,Syrah
103460,Riposte 2015 The Dagger Pinot Noir (Adelaide Hills),"Pretty aromas of cherry and plum blossoms give way to fully ripe, slightly confectionary fruit, backed by hints of mocha.

103461,Spann Vineyards 2015 Betsy's Backacher White (California),"Nuances of vanilla and toasted baguette add flair to this full-bodied and textural wine. It has straightforward crisp apple and grapefruit flavors, a dry balance, and a taut, almost astringent finish.",Spann Vineyards,US,88,17,White Blend
103462,Siduri 2008 Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),This California-made Oregon Pinot captures a sense of the particular terroir of Chehalem Mountains fruit. Wild strawberries are laced with peppery spice and a streak of cola. Good penetration and texture.,Siduri,US,88,39,Pinot Noir
103463,Thema 2006 Red (Drama),"Full-bodied aromas of vanilla, ripe blackberry, spice and cinnamon lead this assertive red from Drama. Rich, spicy and savory on the palate, the wine has a nice balance of minerality and layered fruit. The finish has a smoky spin.",Thema,Greece,88,24,Red Blend
103464,Moletto 2001 Colmello Rosso Red (Veneto Orientale),Here's a blend of Merlot and Franconia (aged 48 months in oak) with straightforward aromas of cherry fruit and underbrush.

103469,Hunt Cellars 2004 Maestro Red (Paso Robles),"A robust, softly tannic and powerfully ripe wine showing flavors of cherry pie filling, cola, raisins, red licorice and dusty Asian spices. This dry Bordeaux-style blend contains some Petite Sirah, and is at its best now–2012.",Hunt Cellars,US,88,48,Red Blend
103470,Kings Mountain 2006 Meritage (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Rather tough and gritty now, this bone dry wine offers herb, tobacco and cedar flavors, with suggestions of cherries and currants. It's the answer to folks who complain that California Cabernets are fruit and oak bombs. Could surprise with 5–7 years in the bottle.",Kings Mountain,US,88,48,Meritage
103471,Vinchio-Vaglio Serra 2003 Cantina Tre Serre (Barbaresco),"Cheerful and bright, this well-priced wine offers a great introduction to Barbaresco to those who might be less familiar with this noble Italian wine.

103476,Bishop Creek Cellars 2007 Whole Cluster Reserve Pinot Noir,"Though the winery indicates that just one quarter of the barrels (all French oak) were new, this wine puts those spicy, toasty scents and flavors of mocha and cinnamon front and center.

103477,Château Couhins-Lurton 2007 Pessac-Léognan,"A dry, spicy wine, with some good dense tannins. There is some power here, the dark fruits hinting at sweetness, but this is followed by the high acidity typical of the vintage. It should all come together in a year to 18 months.",Château Couhins-Lurton,France,88,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
103478,Château Fonréaud 2007 Listrac-Médoc,"There is plenty of wood, both in aromas and to taste. What is worrying is the dominance of the wood over the relatively light fruit character.

103653,F X Pichler 2006 Dürnsteiner Kellerberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"A first from Pichler, this is a wine that stopped fermenting while still sweet and offers rich layers of honey, lychees and pepper are all here, as well yellow peaches and honeydew.",F X Pichler,Austria,93,90,Grüner Veltliner
103654,Forefathers 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"This is sort of a second wine of the respected veteran winemaker, Nick Goldschmidt, who bottles his more expensive brand under his last name. But there's nothing second-rate about the wine. It's classic Alexander Valley, soft and a little herbal, and rich in cherry, red currant, licorice, sweet vanilla oak and peppery spice flavors. Lovely now, and with the integrity to evolve for a decade.",Forefathers,US,93,40,Cabernet Sauvignon
103655,Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"A classic Bordeaux blend. Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment.",Andrew Will,US,92,60,Red Blend
103656,Bridlewood 2004 Estate Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Bridlewood has crafted a very serious Syrah, from a region of Santa Barbara County that excels at this Rhône variety. The wine is fully dry and full-bodied, with rich, dense tannins, but what's notable is the depth of flavor. The blackberries, currants, licorice, cola, mocha and smoky oak flavors are very rich. Drink now and for a few years.",Bridlewood,US,92,40,Syrah
103657,F X Pichler 2006 Dürnsteiner Kellerberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Packed with superripe tropical fruits, this is a concentrated, powerful wine, with lychee and smoke flavors. There is intense acidity to counteract all the richness. Finishes sweet and ripe.",F X Pichler,Austria,92,85,Grüner Veltliner
103658,Felipe Rutini 2004 Apartado Red (Mendoza),"Apartado, a high-flying Bordeaux blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot, shows up only occasionally, but when it does it shines. This vintage is stunning; the black cherry and wild berry flavors are lively and honest, while the wine's structure is just where it should be. With a juicy steak or lamb chops, this wine will bowl you over.",Felipe Rutini,Argentina,92,64,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
103659,Prix 2004 Reserve Melange Red (Napa Valley),"Rich in red currant, cassis, licorice, cola, vanilla cream and smoky oak flavors, with a smoothly tannic texture, this wine seems to be Cabernet-based. It's made solidly along Napa cult Cab lines, a softly voluptuous wine that's delicious now, and should age well for many years. From Hagafen.",Prix,US,92,75,Red Blend
103660,Soos Creek 2005 Champoux Vineyard Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon perfectly captures the vineyard's strengths: lush, ripe, fleshy fruit that shows perfectly ripened flavors of cherry and cassis, bolstered by ripe, chewy tannins. It's substantial but not tiring; the balance of fruit, acid and tannins holds it together through a spicy, lingering finish. It's just a delicious wine, and one that should cellar well also.",Soos Creek,US,92,40,Red Blend
103661,Parry Cellars 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"Shows a fine, polished Napa style in the perfectly ripe blackberry and currant flavors, and in the way the sweet and ultrarefined tannins give the wine such classic structure. New oak adds just the right touch of smoke and vanilla to this ageworthy 100% Cab. Best after 2010.",Parry Cellars,US,92,60,Cabernet Sauvignon
103662,Pepper Bridge 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The blend is classic Bordeaux—85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. It's got grip and a sensuous mix of wild herb, black olive and mountain berry. There is plenty of acid to support it, and winemaker J-F Pellet has been pulling back on the new oak, so that newer releases of Pepper Bridge are more structured and tilting more toward a European sensibility, which is to say, ageworthy.",Pepper Bridge,US,92,50,Cabernet Sauvignon
103663,Smith-Madrone 2006 Chardonnay (Spring Mountain District),"Dry, crisp and minerally, this Chard has intensely pure flavors of ripe white peach, pear, green apple and pineapple that have a stony scour of cold steel. It's the opposite of the modern style of oaky fruit bomb Chards, with an elegant integrity that's food-friendly and ageworthy. Fine now, and should do interesting things for a decade.",Smith-Madrone,US,92,28,Chardonnay
103664,Rancho Sisquoc 2007 Flood Family Vineyards Merlot (Santa Barbara County),"Dry and soft, with the taste of cherry, roasted almond, crunchy granola and fig health candy bar. Enjoyable, but simple. Drink now.",Rancho Sisquoc,US,84,20,Merlot
103665,Righteous 2008 Righteous Tempranillo (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This has so much raw, rough oak flavor when first opened that the fruit is nearly invisible. Tempranillo may well have a real future in the Walla Walla Valley, but first it has to be freed from the woods. Give this plenty of breathing time.",Righteous,US,84,24,Tempranillo
103666,Crossbarn by Paul Hobbs 2009 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Oaky and strong in jammy fruit, this Chardonnay has potent pineapple, tropical fruit and buttered caramel popcorn flavors.

103667,Espiritu de Chile 2007 Gran Reserva Carmenère (Curicó Valley),"Tomato leaf, herb and spice aromas mix with green-leaning raspberry and marshmallow sweetness on the nose.

103668,Frenzy 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Light and herbal, with a modest core of grapefruit flavors. Grassy notes soften on the finish, allowing some chalky notes to come through. Drink up.",Frenzy,New Zealand,84,10,Sauvignon Blanc
103669,Happy Canyon Vineyard 2009 Chukker Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"Made from Cab Franc, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, in that order, this is a very flavorful wine, with rich blackberry, black currant, cocoa and cedar flavors. But it's very sharp in acidity, with a jalapeño pepper burn that limits its appeal.",Happy Canyon Vineyard,US,84,20,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
103670,181 2008 Merlot (Lodi),"Soft and simple, with slightly sweet pie-filling flavors of cherries and mocha. A decent, everyday wine for picnics, barbecue and such.",181,US,84,15,Merlot

103672,Provence Rosé 2009 Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"A fresh, high-acid wine, with flavors of raspberry and apple. It's crisp, with fruit that is barely ripe. Needs plenty of chilling.",Provence Rosé,France,84,14,Rosé
103673,Redtree 2009 Moscato (California),"Honey-sweet in orange and vanilla flavors, this wine has a good backbone of acidity that makes it crisp and clean. Drink it with vanilla desserts or even cheesecake.",Redtree,US,84,8,Moscato
103674,Santa Ema 2008 Selected Terroir Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Opens with a mix of toast and dusty, herbal aromas, and with time it turns more saucy than precisely fruity. A bulky wine with a chunky mouthfeel and fleshy flavors of herbal plum. A late wave of tartness and more herbal flavors cements things into place.",Santa Ema,Chile,84,10,Cabernet Sauvignon
103675,Shiloh Road 2008 Chardonnay (North Coast),"A fruity, direct Chardonnay that will appeal to fans for its peach, pear and oak flavors. Not especially complicated, but a fine example of the variety at a good price.",Shiloh Road,US,84,10,Chardonnay
103676,Vinchio-Vaglio Serra 2008 Cantina Tre Serre Barbera (Piedmont),Cantina Tre Serre is a well-priced and informal Barbera with a thin and informal style backed by fruity freshness. There's even a tiny touch of effervescence that adds a perky and peppery sensation to the mouthfeel.,Vinchio-Vaglio Serra,Italy,84,11,Barbera
103677,Yvon Mau 2009 Seigneurs de Bergerac Blanc White (Bergerac Sec),"A bright, creamy wine with light acidity and flavors of green fruits, pears and a strong streak of grapefruit.",Yvon Mau,France,84,,Bordeaux-style White Blend
103678,Longevity 2009 Viognier (Lodi),"Tastes frankly sweet, with sugary flavors of pineapple marmalade, vanilla custard and butterscotch. It's clean in acids and spicy in the finish. If this is your style, enjoy.",Longevity,US,84,18,Viognier
103679,Lucky Star 2009 Pinot Noir (California),"The old saying, you get what you pay for, is perfectly illustrated by this simple Pinot Noir. It's not bad, though, and at this price, will perform the useful function of introducing budding Pinotphiles to the variety.",Lucky Star,US,84,9,Pinot Noir
103680,Jacob's Creek 2009 Pinot Grigio (South Eastern Australia),"This seems to be an attempt at an Italianate style, with modest alcohol levels (11%) and the accompanying lack of fruit expression. It's largely neutral, with hints of underripe pear and white pepper that combine with chalky notes on the finish.",Jacob's Creek,Australia,84,9,Pinot Grigio
103681,La Vierge 2008 Temptation The Affair Red (Walker Bay),"“The Affair” refers to the relationship between the French and Italian varieties in the blend. Sadly, this isn't the hottest affair, with the strong game, red currant, strawberry hull, milk chocolate and smoky dried salami notes all downplayed by the lean mouth and waxy finish.",La Vierge,South Africa,84,28,Red Blend
103682,Luis Felipe Edwards 2009 Reserva Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"Not disappointing given the price. There's some toast and tropical fruit on the nose, and then pineapple and mango flavors. The acidity runs a bit sharp, but overall this is a reasonable, warm-climate, tropical Chard for the money.",Luis Felipe Edwards,Chile,84,9,Chardonnay
103683,MAN Vintners 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape),"Immediate aromas of chalk and peach waft up from the glass, followed by flavors of green lime and asparagus in the round mouth. The finish is a little heavy, but the flavors are nice and it should be a nice companion to summery soups and grilled vegetables.",MAN Vintners,South Africa,84,11,Sauvignon Blanc
103684,Nederburg 2009 Manor House Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape),"Nice herbal notes unfold in the bouquet with notes of lime rind, underripe peach and soft bell pepper coming through in the mouth. The finish is clean, like fresh-cut grass, and the overall experience enjoyable.",Nederburg,South Africa,84,19,Sauvignon Blanc
103685,Robertson Winery 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Robertson),"A soft, approachable Sauvignon Blanc with aromas of yellow florals, ruby red grapefruit and yellow pepper. Riper peach flavors unfold in the mouth supported by solid acidity and a clean finish, Drink now.",Robertson Winery,South Africa,84,10,Sauvignon Blanc
103686,Seresin 2009 Momo Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"A bit broad on the palate, this wine offers ample melon and fig flavors but lacks that vibrant zesty character that so often sets Marlborough Sauvignon apart from the pack. Drink now.",Seresin,New Zealand,84,22,Sauvignon Blanc
103687,Chasseur 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Firm and substantial on the palate, this is a complex Pinot, the red cherry fruit juicy and inviting and the wine layered in Chinese five-spice. Light in texture and weight the wine still offers a sense of place and gravitas.",Chasseur,US,91,40,Pinot Noir
103688,Ruinart NV Brut Rosé (Champagne),"Pale in color, this is dominated by its taut, nervy structure. Crisp red currant and red apple flavors give the fruitiness. A ripe, full-bodied mouthfeel brings out a softer, riper aftertaste.",Ruinart,France,91,90,Champagne Blend
103689,Small Vines 2012 Baranoff Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Planted in 2001 above the Laguna de Santa Rosa near Sebastopol, Baranoff Vineyard is tightly spaced to mostly Calera-clone Pinot, providing the wine's bright raspberry and cherry overtones atop a layering of earth and spice. Thickly structured, it finishes with tart cherry.",Small Vines,US,91,72,Pinot Noir
103690,Kopke NV 20-Years-Old Tawny (Port),"Kopke has an impressive quantity of old tawnies, some of which will have ended up in this wine. It certainly seems older than its 20 years with strong wood flavors, smoky toast and beautiful mature acidity. It is very ready to drink, a fine mature tawny.",Kopke,Portugal,91,56,Port
103691,La Chablisienne 2012 Vaillons Premier Cru (Chablis),"Soft and full-bodied, this offers bright apple and citrus fruits layered with toast from wood aging. Under the broad exterior, the wine is developing more tangy, zesty fruits and a tight texture. It needs to age to bring everything together. Drink from 2017.",La Chablisienne,France,91,35,Chardonnay
103692,Albert Morot 2012 Cent-Vignes Premier Cru (Beaune),"This is an austere wine, packed with tannins and tight acidity. The red fruits are right at the back behind the firm structure.

103693,Alto Moncayo 2010 Veraton Garnacha (Campo de Borja),"Oaky, heavily roasted aromas of hickory, baking spices, coconut and exotic black-fruit scents feed into a chunky but easygoing palate with spicy, barrel-rich flavors of hickory and vanilla as well as baked berry and leather.

103697,Morgan 2012 Twelve Clones Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"An amazingly vivid nose of cherry, eucalyptus and morning dew on wild fennel promises a stunning wine in this clonal combo from Morgan. The flavors aren't quite so mind-blowing, though, as basic fruit-punch elements meet with touches of peppercorn and nutmeg.",Morgan,US,91,34,Pinot Noir

103700,Veuve Doussot 2006 Memory Brut (Champagne),"This is an elegant Champagne, with a burgeoning sense of maturity as well as fresh acidity.

103702,Clos de Chacras 2010 Gran Estirpe Red (Mendoza),"This Malbec-led blend is quite oaky, thus maple, molasses and chocolate aromas ride high alongside blackberry and mild floral notes.

103710,Gancedo 2012 Mencía (Bierzo),"Initial aromas are oaky and a touch raw, but soon they settle on raspberry and plum.

It had only eight months in oak; drink now through 2015.",Gancedo,Spain,91,25,Mencía
103711,Ramos-Pinto 2009 RPLBV Late Bottled Vintage (Port),"Beautifully perfumed, this has ripe blackberry flavors and a relatively dry character.

103824,Domaine des Baumard 2003 Cuvée le Paon Chenin Blanc (Coteaux du Layon),"Now in golden maturity, this is a smooth, unctuous and ripe wine. Honey is the dominant character, a perfumed wild flower honey that is layered with intense acidity that lifts the wine in a beautiful way. A sweet wine yes, but one that is so balanced.",Domaine des Baumard,France,93,,Chenin Blanc
103825,Jean-Luc Colombo 2009 Les Ruchets (Cornas),"Firmly in the style of the vintage, this is dense, full-bodied Cornas, with plenty of fruit. Intense plum, coffee and black olive notes dominate, while the tannins are ripe and plush. Believe it or not, this is actually drinkable now, yet should age easily through at least 2025.",Jean-Luc Colombo,France,93,84,Syrah
103826,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 2009 Domaine de Saint Pierre (Cornas),"Sure, it starts out a bit toasty and cedary, but that wood will surely integrate with the potent plummy, meaty fruit given a few years' time. It's full bodied and a bit coarsely textured for the moment, but finishes long and will clearly benefit from cellaring. Drink 2018–2025.",Paul Jaboulet Aîné,France,93,130,Syrah
103827,Villa S. Anna 2009 Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,"This shows floral and underbrush aromas of violet, forest floor and woodland berries. The palate offers ripe black cherry, red currant, Asian spice and toasted notes. It's structured yet elegant, with firm but fine tannins and nice depth. It's ready now, so enjoy soon.",Villa S. Anna,Italy,93,36,Red Blend
103828,Testarossa 2010 Brosseau Vineyard Chardonnay (Chalone),"This is the most remniscent of Chablis among Testarossa's new Chardonnays. It's a minerally, chalky wine, bone dry and with lots of acidity, which makes it racy and clean. But it also has a solid core of ripe oranges and limes. It's fine to drink now, and could even develop mushroomy bottle complexity over the next six years.",Testarossa,US,93,39,Chardonnay
103829,Testarossa 2010 Niclaire Pinot Noir (California),"Awesomely rich in black cherries, plums, licorice, mocha, cola and sweet oak flavors. Made from selected barrels of the winery's various vineyards around the state, its richness is balanced by brisk acidity and a soft scour of tannins. Drink over the next six years.",Testarossa,US,93,79,Pinot Noir
103830,Louis Sipp 2008 Osterberg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Mango aromas drive this rich wine, full of honey as well as spicy fruits. It is not so much weighty as intense, with a sense of warmth. Now mature and ready to drink, it still retains a youthful fruit character.",Louis Sipp,France,93,40,Gewürztraminer
103831,San Giusto a Rentennano 2010 Chianti Classico,"This hallmark Chianti Classico boasts a heady perfume of violet, underbrush, peach blossom and clove. The palate delivers bright red fruit, pepper and cinnamon with crushed cherry in the forefront. It's nicely balanced and should develop complexity over the next few years but is already delicious.",San Giusto a Rentennano,Italy,93,23,Red Blend
103832,Black Coyote 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Massive fruity extract characterizes this Cabernet. With noble tannins and explosive black currant, cassis and dark chocolate flavors, it defines the modern Napa cult style of soft, delicious complexity. Good to go now, but you're better off holding it for 8–12 years.",Black Coyote,US,93,106,Cabernet Sauvignon
103833,Domaine des Baumard 2010 Savennières,"This is perfectly balanced dry Chenin. It has just the right amount of richness, aided by a touch of vanilla. The green and white fruits are blended with deceptively soft acidity to give a wine that feels full and ripe in the mouth. Good to drink now, but also worth aging for 3–4 years and more. Screwcap.",Domaine des Baumard,France,93,,Chenin Blanc
103834,Domaine Ehrhart 2010 Brand Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Mango aromas and flavors give a sense of the sweetness of the wine. It is rich and full bodied, with spice and pepper notes just hinting at acidity. Keep the wine for 3–5 years.",Domaine Ehrhart,France,93,32,Pinot Gris
103835,Domaine de Fondrèche 2009 Persia Red (Ventoux),"The name is an oblique reference to Shiraz, which forms the basis of this cuvée. It's inky in hue and rather reticent on the nose at first. But swirl it vigorously and be rewarded with layers of cassis, blackberry and black pepper. Full bodied, rich and tannic, its blueberry and cassis fruit lingers on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink 2015–2025.",Domaine de Fondrèche,France,93,30,Rhône-style Red Blend
103836,Antico Colle 2010 Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,"Here's a classically crafted selection, with a lovely floral and earthy fragrance. The palate shows dark-plum and black-cherry flavors laced with white pepper, mint and balsamic accents. While it has tame acidity, it's still tightly wound and needs just a few years to soften and develop additional complexity; drink after 2015. Vi Wines, J & J Importers.",Antico Colle,Italy,93,22,Sangiovese
103837,Wine & Soul 2010 Quinta da Manoella VV Red (Douro),VV refers to the old vines that are at the heart of this impressive wine. It has great concentration both from the richly structured fruit and tannins. New wood comes through richly on this powerhouse of texture and density. Give the wine at least six years to mature.,Wine & Soul,Portugal,93,100,Portuguese Red
103838,Istine 2010 Chianti Classico,"Floral and black fruit aromas are punctuated by spicy notes on the nose of this wine. The delicious palate delivers juicy black-cherry, white pepper, mint and sage along with big but ripe tannins and edgy acidity. Give it a few more years to fully develop. Drink 2015–2020.",Istine,Italy,93,25,Red Blend
103839,Joseph Fritsch 2010 Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"An opulent feeling Riesling, full of peach and pineapple flavors. It's ripe, full in the mouth and textured, its richness masking the dryness of the fruit and the acidity. It could age a few more years—give it 2–4.",Joseph Fritsch,France,93,24,Riesling
103840,Retro 2009 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"Retro makes one of the best, most consistent Petite Sirahs in California. Even though they used to source their fruit from Howell Mountain and this bottling now is from Pope Valley and Calistoga, it still shows the same qualities of complex interest based on impeccable winemaking. It's an amazing wine, dry, full-bodied and tannic, with a complex range of berries, currants, herbs and white pepper. Truly a Petite Sirah for Cabernet lovers. Drink now–2020.",Retro,US,93,32,Petite Sirah
103841,Sojourn 2011 Ridgetop Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This Pinot Noir is from the far or “true” Sonoma Coast, near Annapolis, north of the new Fort Ross-Seaview appellation. It shows its origin in the brisk acidity and delicacy of mouthfeel, as well as the fantastic range of wild red berry, cola, pine, nettle and white pepper flavors that change from second to second. New oak brings toasty, vanilla complexities and wood tannins. This is a delicious wine now, but will age gracefully for at least eight years.",Sojourn,US,93,59,Pinot Noir
103842,Fiuza 2011 Ikon Touriga Nacional (Tejo),"Ikon refers to Touriga Nacional's position as Portugal's iconic grape. It is almost black in color, and profoundly dense and dry with wood tannins at this early stage of development. Yet it promises a palate that's rich and smooth with fruit in time. It's intended for long-term aging so drink from 2017.",Fiuza,Portugal,93,35,Touriga Nacional
103843,Bibbiano 2010 Chianti Classico,"A lovely, wine, with aromas of red cherry, violet and hints of underbrush. The palate delivers succulent wild cherry, cinnamon and natural vanilla flavors with hint of truffle. It has compelling depth but needs time to tame the structured yet elegant tannins. Drink 2016–2025.",Bibbiano,Italy,93,20,Red Blend
103844,Wines & Winemakers 2009 Aguia Moura em Vinhas Velhas Reserva Red (Douro),"This is a smooth, impressively rich wine powered by silky tannins and ripe black fruits. The palate is intensely concentrated with a big, bold structure and a solid feel. It does need some aging, so drink from 2016.",Wines & Winemakers,Portugal,93,18,Portuguese Red
103845,Castellinuzza e Piuca 2010 Chianti Classico,"This gorgeous Chianti Classico boasts lively cherry, strawberry and violet aromas. The mouthwatering palate shows concentrated wild-cherry flavor layered with mint, white pepper and clove. It has fresh acidity and firm tannins that will develop complexity with more bottle age. A textbook Chianti Classico.",Castellinuzza e Piuca,Italy,93,16,Red Blend
103846,Domaine Schoffit 2009 Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Clos Saint-Théobald Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Pale gold-colored wine from an exceptional vineyard. The warmth of the volcanic soil gives richness to the fruit while still keeping some feeling of dryness. It has weight, dried spice and pepper. Honeyed fruits show right at the end. Drink from 2014.",Domaine Schoffit,France,93,60,Gewürztraminer
103847,Gary Farrell 2011 Hallberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Masses of cherries and raspberries in this single-vineyard wine, and also lots of acidity. It cuts across the palate like a squeeze of lime juice, tart and mouthwatering. Oak shows up in this equation as sweet buttered toast. Altogether, it's a complex, elegant, delicious wine that will develop bottle bouquet over the next 10 years.",Gary Farrell,US,93,55,Pinot Noir
103848,Ocone 2008 Calidonio Red (Taburno),"Calidonio is a fascinating and deeply layered wine that is remarkable off the bat thanks to its unique personality and compelling aromatic profile. Piedirosso (85%) is fermented in oak with 15% Aglianico to create tones of black fruit, spicy smoked meat, resin and black licorice. It is smooth and very soft on the close.",Ocone,Italy,92,42,Red Blend
103849,Palari 2007 Faro,"Vintner Salvatore Geraci is the proud producer of Palari Faro, one of the great red wines to emerge from the Mediterranean rim and the island of Sicily. The elegance and finesse is extraordinary and the wine opens with a complex bouquet that sees petite elements of cassis, licorice, tar and tobacco rolled into one.",Palari,Italy,92,,Red Blend
103850,Round Pond 2008 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Quite a good Cabernet, virgorous and dry, with an earthy edge of sweet, dried herbs alongside the blackberries and cedar. More elegant and food-friendly than many of the fruitier, high alcohol, oaky Cabs out there.",Round Pond,US,92,50,Cabernet Sauvignon
103851,S.A. Prüm 2009 Graacher Himmelreich Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"A lovely effort from proprietor Raimund Prüm, this plump, creamy-textured spätlese displays ample minerality—there's a distinctly slate-driven note—allied to ripe apple, stone fruit and citrus. Sweet but not overwhelmingly so, this would be terrific with slightly sweet or spicy dishes.",S.A. Prüm,Germany,92,31,Riesling
103852,Archery Summit 2008 Arcus Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Spicy and assertive, this young, cellar-worthy Pinot Noir just hints at the complexity within. Give it plenty of air time and it opens aromatically with allspice, sandalwood, perhaps some cola and pine needle. The tart and tangy berry fruit is still compact and primary, but fully ripe and nicely sculpted into a well-defined wine from start to finish.",Archery Summit,US,92,100,Pinot Noir
103853,Bernard Baudry 2009 Les Grézeaux (Chinon),"Old vines, at least 60 years old, are the basis for this soft, wood-aged wine. The texture is smooth, with rounded tannins and density. Flavors include licorice, bittersweet chocolate and black cherries.",Bernard Baudry,France,92,,Cabernet Franc
103854,Charles Joguet 2009 Clos du Chêne Vert (Chinon),"This is firmly, tannic, the product of oak cask fermentation as well as aging. The tannins promise long aging, while the ripe black jelly fruit character brings out the richness of the vintage.",Charles Joguet,France,92,,Cabernet Franc
103855,Château d'Epire 2009 Cuvée Spéciale (Savennières),"A wine that combines the richness of the vintage with the extreme flinty texture of young, dry Chenin Blanc. Packed with ripe acidity, it is pure, very crisp, yet for aging.",Château d'Epire,France,92,,Chenin Blanc
103856,Dark Matter 2006 Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"Made in a ripe, soft style that's unusual for Howell Mountain, this Zin could almost be Grenache, or even a big Pinot Noir. The cherry pie filling, raspberry cream and Dr. Pepper flavors are wrapped into soft, gentle tannins. It's a luxurious, exotic Zinfandel whose heat from high alcohol adds a spicy element.",Dark Matter,US,92,100,Zinfandel
103857,Domus Aurea 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Hails from Macul, so it exhibits some normal eucalyptus on the nose along with spice and pointed, slightly piercing berry aromas. The palate is chewy, sweet, modern and ripe, with chunky berry, herb, olive and particularly graphite flavors. Settles on big black fruit and depth. Outstanding Chilean Cabernet with individuality. Best from 2013-2016.",Domus Aurea,Chile,92,60,Cabernet Sauvignon
103858,Rusack 2008 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"A huge wine, explosive in ripe fruit, elaborated with rich oak and wrapped into smooth, sweet tannins. Made from vineyards throughout the county, it dazzles with a complex of blackberry jam, mocha, date, bacon and smoky sandalwood flavors. Really impressive, especially at this price. Drink Now–2015.",Rusack,US,92,25,Syrah
103859,Thomas Fogarty 2008 Windy Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This Pinot Noir needs a few years in the cellar to mellow, although you can decant it now to let it breathe. It's very rich in cherries, raspberries, licorice and sweet, smoky oak, with a soft, silky texture. Shows a real sense of sophistication.",Thomas Fogarty,US,92,50,Pinot Noir
103860,Tudal 2008 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A distinguished Cabernet whose superb tannins, which are firm and ripe and refined, testify to its Napa origins. So does the blackberry and currant fruit, which finishes in a swirl of sweet, smoky cedar wood. Good as it is, it's way too young. Should be best around 2015 and afterward.",Tudal,US,92,55,Cabernet Sauvignon
103861,Viader 2008 Estate Limited Edition Red (Napa Valley),"This interesting wine is an unusual blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and other Bordeaux varieties with nearly half Syrah. It does what Napa does so well, offering a plethora of ripe, delicious cherry, black raspberry, dark chocolate, sweetly smoked oak and peppery spice flavors that are deep and long on the finish. A lovely, accessible wine to drink over the next few years.",Viader,US,92,50,Red Blend
103862,Zotovich Cellars 2010 Estate Viognier (Sta. Rita Hills),"A great Viognier, rich and exotic, showing the powerful fruit you want from this variety, in a balanced, elegant way. With a sweet, buttercream mouthfeel, it's brisk in acidity, with powerful flavors of tangerines, pineapples, golden mango and exotic spices, finished with smoky, sweet oak.",Zotovich Cellars,US,92,28,Viognier
103863,Ca' del Bosco 2006 Pinéro Pinot Nero (Sebino),"From 29-year-old Pinot Nero vines, Pinéro is an elegant and fine still red wine produced by one of Italy's most celebrated sparkling wine houses. Polished and finessed down to the smallest detail (those tiny berry aromas come forth so clearly), this wine shows the potential of the Burgundian variety in Italy.",Ca' del Bosco,Italy,92,,Pinot Nero
103864,Domaine Huët 2010 Le Haut-Lieu Sec (Vouvray),Classic. Beautiful acidity is balanced by just a touch of sweetness. The wine is bright with apple and lime flavors.,Domaine Huët,France,92,28,Chenin Blanc
103865,Donelan 2009 Walker Vine Hill Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Very young, needs plenty of time. Still showing fermentation notes, with brisk, grapey acidity and primary cherry and raspberry fruit flavors. Seems brilliantly constructed and capable of aging, though. Hold until after 2012.",Donelan,US,92,45,Syrah
103866,Beckmen 2008 Purisima Mountain Vineyard Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley),"The combination of very high alcohol and what tastes like residual sugar gives this Grenache an excessively sweet, glyceriney taste. It's fabulously rich in raspberry cream, blackberry jam, mocha, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors. Very flamboyant and delicious, but really more of a dessert wine than a dry table wine.",Beckmen,US,91,48,Grenache
103867,Viento 2009 Underwood Mountain Vineyards 55% Riesling/45% Gewurztraminer Ice Wine Gewürztraminer-Riesling (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"A field blend ice wine—don't see that very often—it's full-bodied, almost lush, and packed with mixed slightly candied fruits—tropical, stone fruits and citrus. Concentrated and poised, it balances on fresh acidity. Just a hint of plastic in the back of the finish.",Viento,US,91,60,Gewürztraminer-Riesling
103868,Villa Matilde 2004 Camarato Red (Falerno del Massico),"Camarato is a beautiful wine and the 2004 vintage shows impressive harmony and elegance. The wine opens with aromas of chocolate, black cherry and spice. In the mouth, it shows firm, enduring tannins. Pair it with a succulent steak.",Villa Matilde,Italy,91,,Red Blend
103869,Wine Spots 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The upside of the recession is that wines this good are being sold for lower prices, which is great news for consumers. This Cabernet, basically a négociant's blend, is really delicious. It's rich, dry, tannic and lush in blackberry and cherry tart, chocolate and smoky cedar flavors.",Wine Spots,US,91,25,Cabernet Sauvignon
103870,Clos Pegase 2009 Mitsuko's Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Carneros),"The best Clos Pegase Sauvignon Blanc in years. Made with a little oak, just enough for creaminess, it's marked by vibrant acidity and complex, lovely flavors of lemongrass, Meyer lemon candy, vanilla, white pepper and the distinct minerality that Carneros white wines often display. Great price for a wine this sophisticated.",Clos Pegase,US,91,20,Sauvignon Blanc
103871,Domaine des Baumard 2007 Clos de Saint-Yves (Savennières),"A finely crafted wine, its tight acidity generating a very fresh profile. There is an intensity of fruit as well as a mineral texture. For aging. Screwcap.",Domaine des Baumard,France,91,,Chenin Blanc
103872,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2009 Berncasteler Doctor Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"The Thanisch wines from the Doctor vineyard rarely stand out in our magazine's blind tastings, making their value proposition questionable. That said, this is a finely elegant wine, with floral details on the nose and enduring stony notes on the finish that mark it as something special. At only 7.5% abv, you'd expect an intensely sweet wine, but the sugars are amply buffered by acids and minerality, so the overall impression is one of richness without excessive weight rather than sugary sweetness.",Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch),Germany,91,84,Riesling
103873,Elyse 2007 Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"A real bruiser of a Zinfandel, dark in color, dry and tannic, brimming with massive flavors of wild blackberries, blueberries, dark chocolate and pie spices. The tannins are hard, in the way of this mountain. Drink Now–2013 before it loses fresh fruit.",Elyse,US,91,37,Zinfandel
103874,Francis Tannahill 2008 Passito White (Oregon),"A blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, this was made in the passito style—grapes were dried to concentrate sugars, then pressed and fermented. The result is a terrific and unusual dessert wine, with candied fruits mixing papaya, guava, banana, Meyer lemon and more. The center is simply lush and fruity; the finish tails off gently with a honeyed kiss.",Francis Tannahill,US,91,28,Rhône-style White Blend
103875,Lachini 2008 Lachini Family Estate Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Smooth as silk, all estate-grown, this classy Pinot lists five Dijon clones, Pommard, Wadenswil and “Suitcase clone La Tache” on its tech sheet. Vibrant and spicy, with cherries galore (sounds like a James Bond heroine) and a round, full, lush and satisfying mouthfeel. This is the one to drink now, while you cellar the Cuvée Giselle.",Lachini,US,91,45,Pinot Noir
103876,Masciarelli 2007 Castello di Semivicoli (Trebbiano d'Abruzzo),"Named for a beautifully restored castle and boutique hotel in Abruzzo, this beautiful Italian white (made with Trebbiano grapes) shows a delicious creamy texture with abundant aromas of stone fruit, honey and toasted almond. The wine is thick and textured on the close.",Masciarelli,Italy,91,50,Trebbiano
103877,Castle Rock 2008 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A nice, everyday Pinot, with a properly silky texture. The cherry, cola, red licorice and bacon flavors are satisfyingly rich, with elaborate oak overtones. It's a pretty good value in an under-$20 Pinot Noir.",Castle Rock,US,86,18,Pinot Noir
103878,Château Moncontour NV Brut Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay (Crémant de Loire),"Somewhat hard-edged wine, showing the sharpness of young Chenin Blanc. It has a future, though, as this edge drops away, because there is some good weight as well as bright fresh final acidity. Keep for several months.",Château Moncontour,France,86,17,Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay
103879,Derbes 2006 Chardonnay (Carneros),"Very rich, ripe and oaky, but something of a fruit-oak bomb. Blasts the palate with pineapple jam, toasty meringue, caramel and buttered toast aromas and flavors. Lacks subtlety.",Derbes,US,86,36,Chardonnay
103880,Frog's Leap 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),"With no oak, this wine's inherent fruit stars, showing citrus, melons and peaches. With crisp acidity, it's clean, brisk and entirely dry, despite relatively low alcohol. But it's strong in those perfumed pyrazines that turn some people off.",Frog's Leap,US,86,18,Sauvignon Blanc
103881,Hellbent 2008 Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia),"Juicy and extracted, with bright jam tones and an open-knit structure. There's plenty of berry fruit here and a nice plum tone to the palate that carries over to the fleeting finish. A good choice for a big crowd.",Hellbent,Australia,86,12,Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon
103882,Washington Hills 2008 Riesling (Washington),"At 2.3% residual sugar, this is nicely balanced between sweet and dry. The fruit links peach, apricot and pear with a honey in tea streak that carries into the finish.",Washington Hills,US,86,10,Riesling
103883,Ramos-Pinto NV White Reserva (Port),"Great nutty aromas come from the glass and follow into the palate of this sweeter style of white Port. It is rich, packed with almonds and a tangy orange zest edge.",Ramos-Pinto,Portugal,86,,White Port
103884,Sesti 2008 Rosso di Montalcino,"Here's a light and refreshing Rosso di Montalcino with sharp notes of berry, cherry, wet earth and violets. You'll also get some distant mineral tones that add dimension and personality. Pair this easy-drinking wine with your favorite home-cooked pasta dishes.",Sesti,Italy,86,,Sangiovese Grosso
103885,Tagaris 2007 Frank Chiullino Chef Blend Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This red wine, named for the chef at the winery restaurant, is fruity and high-toned, with lots of cherry and berry flavor. All neutral oak, soft tannins, ready to drink.",Tagaris,US,86,55,Red Blend
103886,Las Colinas Del Ebro 2008 Syrah-Grenache (Terra Alta),"Aromas of fresh tomato, citrus peel and red fruits are a touch austere, but the mouth and flavors are more generous. The palate is well balanced and the flavors run sweet, ripe and chewy, with berry fruit and creamy licorice notes on the finish. A blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Garnacha from Catalonia.",Las Colinas Del Ebro,Spain,86,12,Syrah-Grenache
103887,Marquee 2008 Classic Chardonnay (Victoria),"A solid value, the Marquee Victoria Chardonnay has an appealing restraint, hitting pretty high notes on the nose but turning serious and weighty in the mouth. The cream and papaya flavors reach a nice intensity before fading to a mouthwatering finish of guava and pine nuts. Drink now.",Marquee,Australia,86,12,Chardonnay
103888,Anciano 2003 Reserva Tempranillo (Valdepeñas),"Definitely an herbal wine, with tomato, oregano, pizza sauce and savory aromas. The palate has good snap and verve to it, while the feel is on the lean side. Flavors of baked berry, earth, caramel and coffee ring true, and the dry, toffee-tinged finish is a nice ending. Ready to go now.",Anciano,Spain,86,12,Tempranillo
103889,Avery Lane 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington),"As with the Avery Lane Merlot, this is a rather complex blend, here including Syrah, Cab Franc and Lemberger. Fruity and spicy, with strawberry and cherry candy flavors. Very pleasing picnic wine.",Avery Lane,US,86,10,Cabernet Sauvignon
103890,Beltane Ranch 2009 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley),"A nice, rich Sauvignon Blanc for drinking now with lots of different kinds of foods.

103891,Bodegas Docampo 2008 Viña do Campo White (Ribeiro),"Tight and largely neutral white fruit aromas show a little apple but little more. The palate is friendly and easy, with melon as the lead flavor. Turns more citrusy and weighty on the finish, which fades fast.",Bodegas Docampo,Spain,86,18,White Blend
103892,Cortes de Cima 2009 Chaminé Red (Alentejano),"A fresh-faced wine, bright with berry fruits, a light layer of tannins and a soft, easy texture. There is some stalkiness but this is great as a delicious, easy wine.",Cortes de Cima,Portugal,86,12,Portuguese Red
103893,Crane Brothers 2006 Crane Ranch Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),"Rich in berry, cherry, cola, pepper and sandalwood flavors, but a bit off in texture. Feels jagged and angular, with some green tannins. Ready now.",Crane Brothers,US,86,36,Syrah

103895,Domaine Henry Pellé 2008 Les Bornés (Menetou-Salon),"Showing pure tropical fruits with a squeeze of lemon, this is a ripe, tasty wine, maybe a little short on acidity, but bringing out ripe lychee and mango flavors.",Domaine Henry Pellé,France,86,,Sauvignon Blanc
103896,El Burro 2008 Kickass Garnacha (Cariñena),"Darker and earthier than most basic Garnachas, with aromas of compost, baked earth, crusty black fruits and leather. The palate has a nice, ripe, bodied feel, while flavors of blackberry and boysenberry bring just the slightest hint of herbal green. Toasty and solid on the finish.",El Burro,Spain,86,13,Garnacha
103897,Enkidu 2006 Fazekas Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"Showing the hard tannins and dryness of a young Petite Sirah, this is the kind of wine you normally would cellar. But there's a little streak of green unripeness that suggests aging will lead nowhere. So drink it now with big, lusty fare.",Enkidu,US,86,34,Petite Sirah
103898,Valle de Salinas 2008 Roble Red (Yecla),"Opens with common berry fruit aromas as well as a medicinal, minty note. The palate has short length and definition along with bouncy medium-depth berry flavors. Warm, simple touches of licorice and mint define the finish. A blend of 60% Monastrell with 20% each Syrah and Tempranillo.",Valle de Salinas,Spain,86,15,Red Blend
103899,Villa San Juliette 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),"A very nice, likeable and super-drinkable Sauvignon Blanc, at an everyday price. Nicely crisp and just slightly sweet, it shows fruity flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, pears and melons.",Villa San Juliette,US,86,12,Sauvignon Blanc
103900,Plaisance Ranch 2014 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Applegate Valley),"Barrel-fermented in neutral wood, this gives a quick whiff of buttered croissant, then dives into a moderately ripe palate with lime, pineapple and lemon rind. It's an all-purpose and appealing wine that is drinking nicely right now.",Plaisance Ranch,US,87,25,Chardonnay
103901,Poggiobello 2014 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Colli Orientali),"This opens with aromas of hay, pressed yellow flower and orchard fruit. The direct palate offers yellow apple skin, toasted nut and a mineral note alongside invigorating acidity.",Poggiobello,Italy,87,24,Pinot Grigio
103902,Previous 2013 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"Closed and youthful, this wine is medium in build and subtle in oak. It conveys a briny streak throughout the palate, and a distinct taste of candied lemon.",Previous,US,87,22,Chardonnay
103903,Primosic 2014 Santa Lucia Pinot Grigio (Collio),"Gold with copper hues, this opens with aromas of wildflower, tangerine zest and a whiff of crushed stone.

103904,Quinta da Romeira 2014 Prova Régia Arinto (Lisboa),Arinto is the real local grape of the small city of Bucelas where this quinta is located. This fresh wine shows its light mineral and citrus character very well. It also brings out riper fruit flavors that fill it out and give it a rich character. The wine is ready to drink now.,Quinta da Romeira,Portugal,87,11,Arinto
103905,Roche 2013 Barrel Select American Oak Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros),"Thick, rich and ripe in vanilla, the American oak in this wine is pronounced and intense, wrapping itself around notes of candied apple and toffee-caramel.",Roche,US,87,34,Chardonnay
103906,Ronco dei Tassi 2014 Sauvignon (Collio),"Grapefruit, mineral and freshly cut grass aromas lead the way. On the palate, brisk acidity supports pink grapefruit, tangerine and a mineral note.",Ronco dei Tassi,Italy,87,20,Sauvignon
103907,Sauvion NV Brut Sparkling (Crémant de Loire),"It's the delicious, clean, crisp fruit that's so good about this wine. It is bright with acidity and crisp apple flavors along with a lemon tang texture giving a fine bite. Stylish and fresh, it is a fine apéritif wine in style.",Sauvion,France,87,21,Sparkling Blend
103908,St. Pauls 2014 Plotzner Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige),"Pear, white flower and crushed rock open on the nose. On the vibrant palate, a mineral note wraps around a core of crisp apple while bracing acidity provides the backbone.",St. Pauls,Italy,87,20,Pinot Bianco
103909,La Rajade 2014 Friulano (Collio),"Intense aromas of pressed broom, dried herb, hay and a whiff of tomato vine come together in the glass. The palate is fresh but rather closed, eventually revealing yellow apple skin, mineral and a saline note.",La Rajade,Italy,87,,Friulano
103910,La Tunella 2013 Col Livius Friulano (Friuli Colli Orientali),"Aromas of toasted nut, citrus and oak lead the nose. The linear, rather lean palate shows yellow apple skin, bitter almond and lime zest. A mineral note signals the finish.",La Tunella,Italy,87,22,Friulano
103911,La Vis 2014 Ritratti Pinot Grigio (Trentino),"Fresh and fruity, this lively white offers aromas and flavors of green Anjou pear, Granny Smith apple and white peach. Zesty acidity gives it a crisp, tangy finish.",La Vis,Italy,87,19,Pinot Grigio

103913,Le Cadeau 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Rhubarb and cranberry fruit, along with a touch of red apple suggests minimal ripening. It's a tangy, pleasant wine, light and optimal for near-term drinking with simple poultry dishes.",Le Cadeau,US,87,38,Pinot Noir
103914,Louis de Grenelle NV Platine Brut Sparkling (Crémant de Loire),"A fresh, citrus flavored wine with attractive fruitiness and a crisp texture. There is a yeasty edge that should vanish and leave just fruit. Because it is mainly made from Chenin Blanc, there is a nutty, honeyed aftertaste.",Louis de Grenelle,France,87,22,Sparkling Blend
103915,Manincor 2014 Eichorn Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige Terlano),"Aromas of apple, spring flower, bread crust and crushed rock come together in the glass. The brisk palate offers unripe Kaiser pear, citrusy notes and mineral set against a backbone of racy acidity.",Manincor,Italy,87,30,Pinot Bianco
103916,Meadowcroft 2013 Cornerstone Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This is a tangy, not entirely varietal wine that's dense in black tea and black fruit, with layers of tobacco and dried herb. Give it time in the glass to open.",Meadowcroft,US,87,31,Pinot Noir
103917,Mignanelli 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Pomegranate, dark plum and slate show on the simple nose of this appellation blend. The palate is light, with hints of strawberry and plum as well as pencil lead and mace. It's a great option for chilling a bit and drinking on the beach.",Mignanelli,US,87,36,Pinot Noir
103918,Monteviejo 2013 Lindaflor Chardonnay (Uco Valley),"This waxy, heavily oaked Chardonnay regularly pulls the same score. This vintage has aromas of grapefruit, quince and garlic. Blasting oak and modest acidity result in flatness, while oak resin is by far the dominant flavor, with creamy apple and pithy bitterness lurking.",Monteviejo,Argentina,87,35,Chardonnay
103919,Nals Margreid 2014 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),"The nose of this lively white is a combination of delicate aromas of wildflower and orchard fruit while the bright palate offers tart Granny Smith apple, tangerine and a hint of crushed stone. Vibrant acidity carries through to the crisp finish.",Nals Margreid,Italy,87,20,Pinot Grigio
103920,Nisia 2014 Old Vines Verdejo (Rueda),"Apple, peach and melon aromas are clean and fruity. The palate on this Verdejo is melony, which matches the wine's melon and papaya flavors. On the finish, a note of apple cider is detectable. Because of moderate acidity and some flab, it's advisable to drink this now.",Nisia,Spain,87,17,Verdejo
103921,Passaggio 2014 Lone Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Law enforcement veteran-turned-winemaker Cindy Cosco named this brand for her Italian roots, and presents violet, red cherry and pencil-lead aromas in this bottling. A wild-herb character powers the palate, with bay leaf most prominent, followed by tart elderberries and orange-peel sourness. The grippy palate will open more with age.",Passaggio,US,87,47,Pinot Noir
103922,Plaisance Ranch 2013 Ranch Red (Applegate Valley),"This Bordeaux-style blend is 25% Merlot, the rest an even split between Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Stiff, tannic and earthy, it delivers robust flavors of herb and bark more than ripe fruit. With its assertive tannins, it should stand up well to a grilled tri-tip.",Plaisance Ranch,US,87,25,Red Blend
103923,Quinta do Cavalinho 2013 Templários Colheita Seleccionada Red (Tejo),"A juicy, fruity wine that is named after the Knights Templar who built a magnificent castle and convent in the local city of Tomar. It is fresh with red berry acidity and some perfumed tannins. It should be ready to drink soon, but wait until the end of 2016 for the best results.",Quinta do Cavalinho,Portugal,87,18,Portuguese Red
103924,Rodney Strong 2013 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Leather saddle wafts from the glass atop ripe cherry, blackberry jam and brown sugar. Tightly wound in tannin and oak, this wine becomes pleasantly juicy on the finish.",Rodney Strong,US,87,30,Zinfandel
103925,Ronco Blanchis 2014 Ribolla Gialla (Collio),"The nose is a bit shy but reveals delicate scents of citrus and a whiff of peach blossom while the vibrant palate displays crisp apple, tangerine and a hint of steely mineral. Brisk acidity gives it a clean, refreshing finish.",Ronco Blanchis,Italy,87,15,Ribolla Gialla
103926,Sarah's Vineyard 2011 Old Vine Zinfandel (Santa Clara Valley),"Lavender and lilac are just part of the floral bouquet that emerges from this wine, which also shows a blackberry vinaigrette element on the nose. Once sipped, it's like sucking on a purple-flower candy, with more lavender as well as plum and a pencil-lead edge that cuts through the palate.",Sarah's Vineyard,US,87,30,Zinfandel
103927,St. Pauls 2014 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),"Delicate but alluring scents of spring flower and orchard fruit lift out of the glass.

103928,Tenuta di Angoris 2014 Pinot Grigio (Collio),"Fresh and lively, this opens with aromas of jasmine, tropical fruit and a whiff of flint.

103929,Buena Vista 2013 Attila's Selection Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"This is a thick, rich and very ripe wine, with a charred back note making its way against higher-toned tastes of red raspberry and blackberry. The oak is integrated and the wine softly varietal, but it packs a punch on the palate.",Buena Vista,US,87,38,Zinfandel
103930,Don Cristobal 1492 2010 1492 Red (Mendoza),"Sharp, prickly aromas suggest tart red plum and wild herbs. The palate is a bit heavy and sticky, with sweet, gummy, medicinal berry flavors. Finishes bitter and peppery, with a medicinal aftertaste.",Don Cristobal 1492,Argentina,83,7,Red Blend
103931,Finca El Origen 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Tomato leaf, rhubarb and herbal aromas come in front of a tight, tannic and prickly palate with green, spicy berry flavors. Turns hot and smacky on the finish, with carob and herbal flavors.",Finca El Origen,Argentina,83,8,Cabernet Sauvignon
103932,Glen Ellen 2009 Old Vine Zinfandel (California),"Pretty good for the price, with jammy cherry, berry, cocoa and spice flavors. An easy Zin to drink with BBQ or pasta with tomato sauce.",Glen Ellen,US,83,10,Zinfandel
103933,Manzanita Creek 2005 Carreras Ranch Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A heavy, sweet Zin. With 16% alcohol, it tastes like a simple Port, with raisin, blackberry and chocolate flavors.",Manzanita Creek,US,83,38,Zinfandel
103934,Montepio 2010 Pinot Gris (San Juan),"Salinic and minerally on the nose, with a hint of peach. The palate is wet and light, however the flavors run stalky and tart, with green banana and bitterness leading to a chalky finish. Quaffable.",Montepio,Argentina,83,13,Pinot Gris
103935,Notro 2010 Tinto Fundación Red (Mendoza),"Red plum, tomato and brambly herbal aromas set up a snappy, astringent palate with strained raspberry, spice and herbal flavors. Very dry and acidic as it transitions to the finish. An herbal, sharp-edged red.",Notro,Argentina,83,11,Red Blend
103936,Ochoa 2010 Rosado Garnacha (Navarra),"Salmon colored, with somewhat flat aromas of peach and sweet melon. Sweet on the palate, with weight and thickness along with cantaloupe and a candied aftertaste. Finishes chunky and flat; tasted twice with inconsistent findings. This note reflects the better bottle.",Ochoa,Spain,83,14,Garnacha
103937,Robert Mondavi 2010 Pinot Grigio (California),"Overtly sweet, with a white sugar edge to the citrus fruits, this is basically a dessert wine. Earns extra credit for cleanness and crisp acidity.",Robert Mondavi,US,83,11,Pinot Grigio
103938,Starmont 2009 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),It's all about oak in this Chardonnnay. Not much going on beyond the obvious attempt at flattery with buttered toast and vanilla flavors. Maybe a little peach and pineapple candy thrown in for good measure.,Starmont,US,83,20,Chardonnay
103939,Aveleda 2010 Casal Garcia Tinto Red (Portuguese Table Wine),"Light red wine, with a stalky black currant character. It is very fruity, showing herbs and soft tannins. Almost an apéritif red, certainly one for lightly flavored dishes.",Aveleda,Portugal,83,8,Portuguese Red
103940,Brophy Clark 2009 G-S-M (Santa Ynez Valley),"This blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre is unbalanced. It's sweet in dessert red berry fruit, with an awkward streak of acidity.",Brophy Clark,US,83,13,G-S-M
103941,Caligiore 2008 Organic Legacy Old Vines Malbec (Mendoza),"Sweet and syrupy smelling, with maple-covered doughnut and muddled spice and tree bark aromas. The palate is more cutting and acidic than expected, with a sheer mouthfeel and heavy vanilla and oak flavors covering up underdeveloped red fruit notes. Hard, crisp and tannic stuff.",Caligiore,Argentina,83,25,Malbec
103942,Caligiore 2010 Pianissimo Rosé (Mendoza),"Heavy and stalky smelling, with burnt aromas. The leaden palate is weighty and short on freshness; tastes pithy and stalky, with some nectarine and plum thrown in. Seems to be fading.",Caligiore,Argentina,83,10,Rosé
103943,Cedar Mountain 2007 Hansen Vineyard Reserve Zinfandel (Livermore Valley),"Funky with prune and tobacco overwhelming any fresher fruit, this Livermore Zin is high in alcohol (15.8%), which coats the tongue for a long time after the wine goes down.",Cedar Mountain,US,83,33,Zinfandel
103944,Concannon 2010 Selected Vineyards Chardonnay (Central Coast),"Simple and sweet, with jammy pineapple, orange and apricot flavors leading to a soft, honeyed finish.",Concannon,US,83,10,Chardonnay
103945,Solar de Urbezo 2010 Dance Del Mar Tempranillo-Merlot (Cariñena),"Sweet red plum aromas are candied and jumbled. The wine is clacky in the mouth, with a lot of acidity and narrow, sweet cherry flavors. Shows heat and burn on the finish. 50% Tempranillo-50% Merlot.",Solar de Urbezo,Spain,83,12,Tempranillo-Merlot
103946,Wines & Winemakers 2010 Clemens Reserva White (Vinho Verde),"A soft Vinho Verde, with white fruit flavors, only light acidity and some final sweetness. An attractive apéritif.",Wines & Winemakers,Portugal,83,14,Portuguese White
103947,Cosentino 2008 The Novelist Meritage (California),"A clumsy wine that aims for white Bordeaux in style and falls far short. There's plenty of oak and lees, but the underlying wine is thin and disappointing in citrus flavor.",Cosentino,US,83,18,Meritage
103948,De Bortoli 2009 Deen De Bortoli Vat 10 Pinot Noir (South Eastern Australia),"Earthy and tealike, with those attributes framed by charred, nutty oak. It's supple enough to be balanced for immediate consumption.",De Bortoli,Australia,83,15,Pinot Noir
103949,DFJ Vinhos 2010 Coreto Rosé (Lisboa),"Soft, sweet raspberry fruit-flavored wine. It has a line of acidity while its main character is the light, sweet aftertaste. Screwcap.",DFJ Vinhos,Portugal,83,6,Rosé
103950,Yellow Tail NV Bubbles Sparkling White Wine Sparkling (South Eastern Australia),"Yellow Tail's sparkler is an aromatic blend of Semillon, Traminer, Viognier and Trebbiano that manages to be largely neutral on the palate at the same time it's perfumed on the nose. Frothy and off dry.",Yellow Tail,Australia,83,10,Sparkling Blend
103951,Adega Cooperativa Ponte de Barca 2010 Escolha Rosé (Vinho Verde),"On the dry side, with caramel and strawberry flavors, this is an attractive, bright rosé, as fresh as they come.",Adega Cooperativa Ponte de Barca,Portugal,83,5,Rosé
103952,Pasaje Alto 2010 Andes Crossing Malbec (Mendoza),"Smells earthy and leathery, with a grilled meat element to the nose. The palate runs sharp and high in acid, with narrow plum flavors. Doesn't offer a whole lot on the finish. More rubbery and tart than ideal.",Pasaje Alto,Argentina,83,12,Malbec
103953,De Bortoli 2008 DB Family Selection Shiraz (South Eastern Australia),"Herbal and green peppercornish, with dark berry flavors and herbal-vegetal notes. Light and crisp; complex for the price.",De Bortoli,Australia,83,9,Shiraz
103954,Figaro 2009 Tinto Red (Calatayud),"Starts out with leather and cheesy aromas, and beyond that there's not a lot of fruit on the bouquet. It's a chunky, heavy wine with thick, jammy plum flavors that have strong herbal undertones. Warm, grabby and baked on the finish, which is plodding.",Figaro,Spain,83,10,Red Blend
103955,Fattoria di Casalbosco 2006 500ml (Vin Santo del Chianti),"This is a less formal Vin Santo. The wine is creamy and thick, with sweet syrupy notes of chestnut, honey, maple, candied fruit and dried apricot.",Fattoria di Casalbosco,Italy,90,,White Blend
103956,Georges Duboeuf 2009 Clos des Garands (Fleurie),"Dominated by its dry tannins, this is a tight black currant and dark plum skin-flavored wine, surrounded by a firm core of tannins, a firm and dark-hued wine.",Georges Duboeuf,France,90,,Gamay
103957,Georges Duboeuf 2009 Sélection (Moulin-à-Vent),"There is great structure here, with dusty tannins percolating through the rich wine. It has power, concentration and density, with cocoa and cherry flavors well integrated. Think about aging for 1–2 years.",Georges Duboeuf,France,90,,Gamay
103958,Jarvis 2008 Will Jarvis' Science Project Red (Napa Valley),"This weirdly named wine is a blend of 95% Cabernet Franc and 5% Merlot. It's a bit soft and melted in texture, like liquid licorice, with flavors of cherries, red currants, mocha, anise and smoky oak, and the finish is dry. Notable for the elegance and purity of its tannin structure.",Jarvis,US,90,105,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
103959,Kingston Family 2008 Alazan CJ's Barrel Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),"Big, dark and brash, and very much in the modern California style, meaning it's rich, creamy, oaky and full-bodied. The nose brings toast, heat and potency, while the flavors are saturated, spicy and revolve around wild berry, tea, spice, caramel and savory warmth. Only gets better as it opens and airs; drink now through 2012.",Kingston Family,Chile,90,32,Pinot Noir
103960,Lapostolle 2007 Cuvée Alexandre Las Kuras Vineyard Syrah (Cachapoal Valley),"Opens with heavy aromas of raisin, prune, leather and chocolate. The palate is just racy enough, with depth, big tannins and structure. Tastes grapy and big, with blackberry fruit and a chocolaty aftertaste. Toasty and a little gritty and tannic on the finish, and ultimately it's a little sweet but still impressive for Chilean Syrah.",Lapostolle,Chile,90,24,Syrah
103961,Syncline 2009 Subduction White White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The latest version of this popular blend drops the Chardonnay and adds 11% Grüner Veltliner to the Roussanne-Viognier blend. It seems to elevate the aromatics, pushing lush scents of lemon drop, pineapple, and candied orange peel forward. Those perfectly rendered citrus peel flavors put a frame around the tart fruit, and there is a hint of white pepper in the spicy finish.",Syncline,US,90,18,White Blend
103962,Trapiche 2008 Broquel Bonarda (Mendoza),"Round, thick and pulsing, but not too hard, angular or tannic. The nose brings richness, smoke and black fruits, while the palate is juicy, focused and forward, with black-fruit flavor galore and a slight creamy character. Drying and toasty on the finish, with snappy acidity through the final drop.",Trapiche,Argentina,90,17,Bonarda
103963,Loimer 2009 Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),"Pure, perfumed wine, its floral currant flavored fruit dancing in the glass. There is a bright lift to this delicious fruity wine, just demanding to be drunk. Screw cap.",Loimer,Austria,90,,Riesling
103964,Louis Latour 2008 Les Beaumonts Premier Cru (Vosne-Romanée),"A solid, dense wine, packed with tannins and with a dry core. The soft fruit has flavors of strawberry, hinting at richness to come. At this early stage, tannins and acidity are still forming. Hold for five years.",Louis Latour,France,90,140,Pinot Noir
103965,Louis Latour 2008 Les Damodes Premier Cru (Nuits-St.-Georges),"There is a voluptuous edge to this generous wine. It has rich flavors, some strawberry and plum juice. The final extreme freshness shows through the layer of firm tannins. For aging over 4–5 years.",Louis Latour,France,90,95,Pinot Noir
103966,M by Michael Mondavi 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Made from the winery's little vineyard on Atlas Peak, this 100% Cabernet needs time to come around. It doesn't show the voluptuous approachability of the 2005 or the 2007, which will be released next year. It's fairly acidic and tannic. But there's a luscious core of blackberries and black currants. Try after 2012; it might be a very long-lived wine.",M by Michael Mondavi,US,90,195,Cabernet Sauvignon
103967,Margerum 2007 M5 Red (Santa Barbara County),"A Châteauneuf-du-Pape-style Rhône blend that really nails it for satisfaction. Rich and fruity, spicy, yet with great structure. Defines the vintner's art of blending, comprised of five varieties sourced from a dozen vineyards. Fun and serious at the same time.",Margerum,US,90,24,Rhône-style Red Blend
103968,Pedroncelli 2007 Family Vineyards Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley),"This is a great value in a Petite Sirah that shows how well the variety performs in a great vintage in a warmer climate. With 20% Syrah, which seems to add richness and nobility, the wine is bone dry and elegant in mouthfeel, with complex blackberry, black currant, grilled beef, black pepper and cedar flavors. Drink now.",Pedroncelli,US,90,15,Petite Sirah
103969,Pietro Beconcini 1999 Caratello (Vin Santo del Chianti),"This 60-40 blend of Trebbiano Toscano and Malvasia Bianca offers a traditional interpretation with thick sweetness and aromas of roasted chestnut, caramel and honey.",Pietro Beconcini,Italy,90,,White Blend
103970,Boekenhoutskloof 2007 Syrah (Coastal Region),"This is a robust and firmly structured Syrah with medium-coarse tannins and medium-full weight. Meaty and dark with notes of licorice, black currant, sweet spice and a touch of cocoa on the finish. Though it's intense, it still feels like it's holding back a little bit; try after 2012 for a more forward presentation.",Boekenhoutskloof,South Africa,90,47,Syrah
103971,Bortolotti NV Cartizze Dry (Valdobbiadene Superiore di Cartizze),"The Cartizze cru is known as the best area for growing quality grapes for Prosecco. This precious expression shows drying mineral tones backed by sweet fruit, melon and peach. The soft, creamy quality if the perlage is also noteworthy.",Bortolotti,Italy,90,,Glera
103972,Chanson Père et Fils 2007 Gevrey-Chambertin,"Big, structured and solid, with powerful dense fruit, this is packed with plum juice flavors. The wine feels chunky, while the acidity keeps everything in proportion.",Chanson Père et Fils,France,90,,Pinot Noir
103973,Château Cambon la Pelouse 2008 Haut-Médoc,"With hints of mint, and a firm structure from wood as well as tannins, this is a flattering wine. The tannins are rich, layered within the jammy black berry fruits. This is a wine for aging, but is deceptively attractive now.",Château Cambon la Pelouse,France,90,25,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
103974,Château Lilian Ladouys 2008 Saint-Estèphe,"Since the futures tasting in 2009, the wood element has been tamed. It is still an important factor, but the fruit has blossomed, showing a solid core of tannins, surrounded by dark plum and red fruit flavors. It will need many years, but everything is here now.",Château Lilian Ladouys,France,90,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
103975,Corison 2006 Kronos Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"You need to give this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon time in the cellar. It's nowhere near ready, even if you're used to tannins in your reds. It's hard as nails in astringency. This 2006 vintage doesn't have quite the concentration of the ‘05, but there are some lovely black cherry and black currant flavors, and they should begin to blossom in 4 or 5 years.",Corison,US,90,98,Cabernet Sauvignon
103976,Longboard 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Just the kind of Sauvignon Blanc the valley produces so well. It's flavorful in citrus fruits, peaches, golden mangoes and honey, yet balanced with racy acidity. The dry, crisp finish makes it an ideal cocktail sipper.",Longboard,US,90,20,Sauvignon Blanc
103977,Margerum 2007 Colson Canyon Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"If more Syrah tasted like this, more people would drink it. Beautifully ripe and soft, pure and rich in cherry and raspberry liqueur, smoke and pepper flavors. Ready now.",Margerum,US,90,36,Syrah
103978,Nicolis 2006 500ml (Recioto della Valpolicella Classico),"Inky dark in appearance and concentration, this muscular Recioto della Valpolicella Classico wraps your tongue tight with its blockbuster power and persistency. Aromas include blackberry jelly, chocolate, cola and exotic spice. It finishes with smooth firmness and loads of personality.",Nicolis,Italy,90,37,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
103979,Giacomo Ascheri 2006 Cristina Ascheri (Gavi di Gavi),"A pleasant wine that shows a sweet, spicy apricot nose; on the palate it has an interesting smokiness that works well with the fruit, and although there is a fair amount of alcohol, the fruit just manages to cover it, and the wine moves to a pleasant if not particularly long finish.",Giacomo Ascheri,Italy,85,20,Cortese
103980,Saint Clair 2007 Vicar's Choice Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"A lightweight Sauvignon Blanc that fits the standard Marlborough profile, with slightly grassy notes layered over grapefruit and pineapple flavors. Drink now.",Saint Clair,New Zealand,85,16,Sauvignon Blanc
103981,Covey Run 2005 Quail Series Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Light and fruity with pineapple, melon and apple. This fruit forward, food-friendly wine has natural acids and a delicate balance. For the money it is a fine choice to accompany seafood, poultry and pasta salads.",Covey Run,US,85,9,Chardonnay
103982,Bearboat 2004 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A nice wine, good and dry. It has forward peach, pineapple, apricot and oaky vanilla and caramel flavors, and a finely acidic finish.",Bearboat,US,85,20,Chardonnay
103983,Spy Valley 2006 Pinot Gris (Marlborough),"Thickly textured and rather sweet, with superripe apples and pears that at times seem almost drenched in honey. Probably best on its own, well-chilled as a hot-weather apéritif.",Spy Valley,New Zealand,85,25,Pinot Gris
103984,Jurtschitsch 2006 Schenkenbichl Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Big, bold and soft, this is way too heavy. Sure, the Grüner spice is all there, but it is at the expense of a fresh, racy character. The toast character doesn't quite work either.",Jurtschitsch,Austria,85,48,Grüner Veltliner
103985,Valdinera 2005 Barbera d'Alba Superiore,"The Valdinara is a soft, seductive wine showing plenty of jammy fruit, and a pleasant smoky spice. On the finish it is a touch stemmy, but it is so slight that it adds an exotic edge to the wine. Pleasant, not very intense and easy to like.",Valdinera,Italy,85,23,Barbera
103986,X 2005 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"This is a heavy, bitterly tannic young wine that shows ripe blackberry and coffee flavors and spices. The raw astringency makes it tough now, fit only for greasy foods like barbecued ribs. It should age well for a long time, but will never quite overcome its rustic profile.",X,US,85,25,Petite Sirah
103987,Renato Ratti 2004 Villa Pattono Red (Monferrato),"The Ratti proved to be a rich, pleasant, gentle wine, showing lots of plummy fruit, not much acidity and a medium finish.

103988,Michele Chiarlo 2005 Le Monache Red (Monferrato),"Chiarlo tends to be one of the more reliable producers in Piedmont, and this comes across as a pleasant everyday wine. The fruit is very ripe, bordering on the superripe; but on the palate, the wine has some interesting flavors, dark cherry fruit and hints of licorice and green olive.",Michele Chiarlo,Italy,85,13,Red Blend
103989,Pertinace 2006 Dolcetto d'Alba,"The Pertinace offers a a soft, spicy nose of blackberry jam, vanilla and cinnamon. A pleasant, everyday, food-friendly wine that can be drunk now but has the structure to improve for a year or so. Imported by MW Imports.",Pertinace,Italy,85,15,Dolcetto
103990,Pertinace 2006 Roero Arneis,"The Pertinace evolved nicely in the glass; at first there are simple lime peel aromas, but over time, they become richer and slightly more complex. On the palate there is pear, as well as the lime and an interesting smoky quality. Crisp and with good balance, the finish is a little short. Imported by MW Imports.",Pertinace,Italy,85,16,Arneis
103991,Poderi Luigi Einaudi 2004 Dolcetto di Dogliani,"The Einaudi is a fairly hefty version of a Dolcetto, having lost some fruit but gaining an interesting earthy character to the palate. Structurally a little on the chunkier side, but with good concentration. The finish is solid but dominated by the earthiness. Should be drunk soon.",Poderi Luigi Einaudi,Italy,85,21,Dolcetto
103992,Seia 2005 Alder Creek Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"This is very soft upon entry, with remnants of penetrating spicy and herbal flavors that might have punched up the intensity if they hadn't been somehow smoothed over. It's difficult to assess, because many of the right pieces are all here, but somehow they have not jelled. The wine tastes acidic and sharp, with pineapple and citrus dominating, and a chalky, tannic finish. Perhaps it's just a matter of time?",Seia,US,85,30,Syrah
103993,Kindred 2005 Marsanne-Roussanne-Viognier White (Russian River Valley),"This Rhône blend is soft and sugary sweet, with a honeyed, vanilla fudge and smoky oak edge. The underlying wine flavors are of peaches, pineapples and yellow apricots.",Kindred,US,85,32,Rhône-style White Blend
103994,Maddalena 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),"Like its vintage predecessors, this seems to have some residual sugar, which gives a honeyed sweetness to the peach, pear, fig and honeysuckle flavors. But it has a very crisp, pleasant acidity that keeps the wine lively.",Maddalena,US,85,13,Sauvignon Blanc
103995,Beringer 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Tangy acidity is the star here. It gives structure and backbone to the lemon, lime, pineapple and fig flavors, and makes the wine a great cocktail sipper.",Beringer,US,85,16,Sauvignon Blanc
103996,Familia Schroeder 2006 Deseado Torrontés (Neuquén),"Sweet and frothy, and made quite close to the Moscato style, meaning the nose is full of flowers and lime. The palate is a mix of crushed children's vitamins, mango and ripe melon.",Familia Schroeder,Argentina,85,13,Torrontés
103997,Il Falchetto 2006 Tenuta Del Fant (Moscato d'Asti),"Very laid back, the nose shows some mango and pear, but you really have to go looking for them.

103998,Red Newt Cellars 2012 Sawmill Creek Vineyards North Block Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Flighty and delicate on the palate, this refreshingly mineral semi-sweet wine is juicy with sweet apple flavor accented with brisk lime acidity.

104000,Silver Thread 2012 Semi-dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Delicate lavender and herb notes perfume this pretty off-dry wine.

104001,Telmo Rodríguez 2012 g Dehesa Gago (Toro),Minerally black plum and boysenberry aromas set up a rubbery palate with medium weight and intensity.

104002,Breaux 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Virginia),"Precise yellow grapefruit, currant bud and apricot notes lead onto the medium-bodied, zesty palate. The grapefruit note remains dominant on the palate, and the lively acids give it a vibrant edge.",Breaux,US,88,19,Sauvignon Blanc
104003,Chakras 2009 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Aromas of brick dust, tobacco, red flowers and cassis come with a touch of herbal green scents.

104009,Covington 2012 Klipsun Vineyard Blanc Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Red Mountain),"Roughly half stainless-fermented Sauvignon Blanc and half barrel-fermented Sémillon, this has noticeable sweetness that puts a sugary edge on the flavors.

104015,Ken Wright 2011 Celilo Chardonnay (Washington),"On the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge, the Celilo Vineyard is an exceptional site for Chardonnay. This was sourced from the 1983 planting, and the relatively old vines and cool vintage deliver a wine with excellent minerality, lift, drive and focus. The fruit is tangy and yellow/green, but perfectly ripe; the acid underpinning is fresh and lively. This has every chance of cellaring until 2024 or later.",Ken Wright,US,88,32,Chardonnay
104016,Kim Crawford 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"For a wine with such a large volume (over half a million cases were imported to the U.S.), the quality is admirable. Passion fruit and grapefruit elements dominate, while some grassier notes emerge as the wine sits in the glass, resulting in a pleasant blend of tropical and herbal notes. It's plump on the midpalate, then gains focus on the lengthy, mouthwatering finish.",Kim Crawford,New Zealand,88,18,Sauvignon Blanc

This is full-bodied Cava with a smooth, robust finish.",Llopart,Spain,88,24,Sparkling Blend
104018,Maimai 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Hawke's Bay),"This Hawkes Bay wine seems to be trying to out-Marlborough Marlborough. Scents of crushed tomato leaves are aggressively green, while the acids are crisp, to say the least. That said, it comfortably rides the border between pleasure and pain, ending with notes of razor-like lime juice and soothing, dusty chalk.",Maimai,New Zealand,88,16,Sauvignon Blanc
104019,Masseria Felicia 2012 Anthologia Falanghina (Falerno del Massico),"Polished and sleek, this wine opens with tropical fruit and citrus aromas.

The wine is easy to like now for its dryness and elegance, despite relatively high alcohol. It shows California ripeness of fruit, with a smooth integration of oak.

104324,W.H. Smith 2007 Umino Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Grown in the Sebastopol Hills area, this Pinot tastes very young and jammy and immature. Released at less than a year of age, it's thick and a little heavy, with cherry, currant and mocha flavors not yet meshed with oak. One wonders why the winery didn't hold it back another year or so. But it could develop in the bottle. Try after 2010.",W.H. Smith,US,89,48,Pinot Noir
104325,Watershed 2005 Awakening Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River),"Lifted and juicy, this impressive effort from Western Australia shows woodsy, cedary notes on a restrained nose.

104328,Daedalus Cellars 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Fragrant and soft, this nicely oaked Pinot Noir offers cherry, cola, mocha and toast flavors. If there is a critique to be made, it is that the finish, though clean and pure, feels just a little flat in the mouth, not as lively as the entry promises.",Daedalus Cellars,US,88,30,Pinot Noir
104329,Fournier Père et Fils 2005 Grand Cuvée Fournier Vieilles Vignes (Sancerre),"A rich wine from a ripe year. The flavors are full and open, edged with a mushroom character that suggests maturity.

104492,Trinity Hill 2014 Gimblett Gravels Syrah (Hawke's Bay),"Made in a ready-to-drink, approachable style, this would be a fine introduction to Hawke's Bay/Gimblett Gravels Syrah.

Drink this medium-bodied wine now through 2020.",Trinity Hill,New Zealand,91,35,Syrah
104493,Trione 2011 Block Twenty One Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"This is a standout wine from the vintage, made from a selection of the Trione Cloverdale Ranch. Blended with smaller percentages of Merlot, Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec, it sings in robust red and black cherry and currant, as well as more luxurious waves of chocolate and vanilla. There's a forwardness to the texture, making for a wine that's both big and happy.",Trione,US,91,67,Cabernet Sauvignon
104494,WesMar 2013 Balletto Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A light, clear and bright wine from the heart of the appellation, this bottling exudes juicy layers of earthy cardamom spice and dark black cherry.

104495,Jean-Max Roger 2013 Vieilles Vignes (Sancerre),"This wine shows how well Sancerre can age. While the initial herbal fruitiness has calmed down, the citrus and green fruit is still vibrant and crisp. The fruit has been joined by a touch of spice, pepper and a hint of toast from the partial wood aging. Drink this wine now.",Jean-Max Roger,France,91,,Sauvignon Blanc
104496,JM Cellars 2013 Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, this wine brings aromas of iron and huckleberry pie. The blueberry and earth flavors are quite ripe, lingering on the finish.",JM Cellars,US,91,48,Syrah
104497,Lynmar 2014 Old Vines Quail Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Ripe, voluptuous blackberry and cherry overlie a dusty undercoat of tannin and minerality. These come across as rocky on the palate, complemented by moderate acidity and a rich texture. The fruit shows a maturity of both ripeness and attitude.",Lynmar,US,91,80,Pinot Noir
104498,Maison Stéphane Brocard 2014 Closerie des Alisiers Vieilles Vignes (Gevrey-Chambertin),"The mature vines in the name of the wine are 40-years-old. The result is a firm structured wine although one with plenty of soft red fruits in the background. They are developing well, bringing with them acidity and good potential. Drink this wine from 2018.",Maison Stéphane Brocard,France,91,48,Pinot Noir
104499,Gottfried Mocke Wine Projects 2015 Cape Winemakers Guild Pinot Noir (Coastal Region),"Winemaker: Gottfried Mocke. If you like herbal, minty Pinots, then this wine is definitely for you. Intense aromas of eucalyptus, rooibos tea, pomegranate, fennel bulb and currant leaf are at the forefront of the bouquet and carry through to the lifted, mentholated palate. The medium-weight palate offers fine yet structured tannins and a long, herbal finish. Drink now–2020.",Gottfried Mocke Wine Projects,South Africa,89,,Pinot Noir
104500,Nicky Versfeld 2015 Cape Winemakers Guild Double Barrel Semillon (Darling),"Winemaker: Nicky Versfeld. The bouquet of this wine is currently a bit closed and restrained, with only delicate notes of fresh herbs, fig leaf, peach and sweet citrus to be discovered upon deep nosing. The palate is rich, full and smoothly textured, as oaky tones of sweet spice and honeyed nuts overwhelm the delicate fruit profile. A bit more integration and harmony should come with some time; try after 2017.",Nicky Versfeld,South Africa,89,,Sémillon
104501,Vriesenhof 2013 Cape Winemakers Guild Pinot Noir (Stellenbosch),"Winemaker: Jan Coetzee. A prominent sanguine character rides atop the fruity scents of tart cherry, rhubarb and small white strawberry on the nose of this wine. A touch sharp and acidic on the palate, it offers soft tannins and tart cherry and currant flavors that are partnered with touches of bramble and game. Drink now–2020.",Vriesenhof,South Africa,89,,Pinot Noir
104502,Nitida 2015 Cape Winemakers Guild Swan Song Sauvignon Blanc (Durbanville),"Winemaker: Bernhard Veller. This is a surprisingly concentrated and wood-dominated Sauvignon Blanc, with initial aromas of yellow melon, grilled peach, cedar plank, orange cream and baking spice. It's full and round on the palate, with a smooth, somewhat flabby texture and forward oak flavors that overwhelm the fruit character.",Nitida,South Africa,89,,Sauvignon Blanc
104503,Wayfarer 2014 The Traveler Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Structured, with years to go to take on added complexity and personality, this wine is also a study in immediate gratification, as it's presently so juicy and easy to enjoy. It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction. The oak and tannin are fully in sync, while a salty, meaty finish provides additional decadence.",Wayfarer,US,98,155,Pinot Noir

It's thick, rich and beautifully put-together, full bodied and entirely balanced, with markings of cherry cordial and white pepper that seduce gently.",Limerick Lane,US,97,50,Zinfandel
104506,Wayfarer 2014 Golden Mean Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Dark, brooding cinnamon and fleshy black plum provide an exciting, complex counterpoint to the rakish earthiness and exotic Asian spice going on in this full-bodied, explosively compelling wine, its minerality lingering. It's young and still tightly coiled, with lingering minerality; let it open to enjoy now, but it would show best after some time, so cellar through 2024.",Wayfarer,US,97,115,Pinot Noir
104507,Calera 2013 Reed Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),"From a vineyard that Josh Jensen planted in 1975 comes this bottling that shows sultry black plum, minty herbs, tarragon, black slate, smashed mulberry and a touch of pork fat. A wondrous array of baked red and black fruit meet with clove, nutmeg, more tarragon and minty flavors on the palate too, producing delicious, dynamic flavor. It's like an expertly cooked stew of fruit, spice and herb.",Calera,US,96,70,Pinot Noir
104508,Wayfarer 2014 Mother Rock Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Youthfully flippant, this block of the Wayfarer Vineyard is sitting largely in sandstone, where the grapes pull remarkably revealing minerality from the soil. Racy and flinty, this medium-bodied, structured and flirty wine dances in a generosity of rich red fruit, raspberry mostly, seasoned in clove and cardamom that's fresh and incredibly seductive. Still, it'll age; drink now through 2024.",Wayfarer,US,96,115,Pinot Noir
104509,Donum 2013 Single Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"With a majority of Pommard clone in this wine contributing to its undeniable breadth and depth, this rich, rewarding wine will benefit from further time in bottle.

104510,Wayfarer 2014 Paige's Ridge Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Floral in aromas and yet darkly savory in cherry and clove, this full-bodied wine holds layered acidity and balanced oak at its core.

104511,Williams Selyem 2014 Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"The Heintz Vineyard is on the outskirts of the AVA, really pushing toward the coast, with the expected cool-climate characteristics of fresh acidity and complex, savory tones. This wine wows in every way, from its notes of exotic coconut meat and apple pie to its tang of Meyer lemon, all accented by bergamot and anise. The spice rides a wave of body and length toward the finish, alongside an unmistakable streak of minerality. Hold through 2024.",Williams Selyem,US,96,58,Chardonnay
104512,Williams Selyem 2014 Westside Road Neighbors Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Oh to have neighbors like these, bringing together several vineyard sites along this coveted stretch of the appellation.

Harlan),"A stunning range of black sage, fresh bay leaf, hearty mulberry, exotic cinnamon, raw beef and baking spice converge for a rugged yet pretty nose on this bottling from a vineyard planted in 1975.

104514,Giuseppe Rinaldi 2012 Brunate (Barolo),"Multifaceted aromas of rose, iris, leather, cranberry, truffle and the barest hint of game lead the nose. The radiant palate offers creamy strawberry, ripe red cherry, orange zest, baking spice, dried herb and tobacco alongside firm but polished tannins. Fresh acidity provides balance while a mineral vein energizes the finish. With its smooth texture, it's already tempting but hold for even more complexity.

104515,Donum 2013 Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The producer's Russian River Valley fruit comes from the Winside Vineyard, planted long ago by Anne Moller-Racke and Joe Nugent. It astounds in this must-have wine, complex and ridiculously velvety in texture. Pepper, clove and cardamom ride huge waves of baked fruit and mocha, with the structure to age through at least 2026, but why wait when it's so delicious now?",Donum,US,95,72,Pinot Noir
104516,Massolino 2012 Parafada (Barolo),"95 Massolino 2012 Parafada (Barolo). A textbook Barolo, this opens with scents of mature berry, leather, underbrush, tobacco and an elegant trace of fragrant blue flower.

Drink 2020–2030.",Massolino,Italy,95,96,Nebbiolo
104517,Patz & Hall 2014 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This voluptuously seductive wine is also elegantly balanced. Citrus, wet stone and sea salt lift the minerality to pronounced levels, accented by a crispness of lemon peel and papaya wrapped in blossoming jasmine. Many of the vines on the site date back nearly 40 years, a demonstration that in age there is beauty.",Patz & Hall,US,95,44,Chardonnay
104518,Byron 2013 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Bruised strawberries and ripe red plums are leveled by iron, ginger snaps, crushed slate and soy on the umami-laden nose of this bottling by Winemaker Jonathan Nagy.

104519,Carlisle 2014 Saitone Ranch Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"The appellation famous for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay packs a powerfully pretty punch when it comes to this variety, too, showing in this wine a soft, focused layering of Luxardo maraschino cherry and touch of cranberry.

Drink now through 2024.",Carlisle,US,95,47,Zinfandel
104520,Château Pierre-Bise 2011 Grand Cru (Quarts de Chaume),"The Grand Cru of Quarts de Chaume juts out over the Layon Valley, with its autumn mists, resulting in the best conditions for noble rot. This luscious wine, gold in color, is so rich, so intense as to be almost overwhelming. It is so young still all rich fruit, peaches, apricots with a touch of ginger. The wine, with its background of considerable acidity, will develop slowly; drink from 2020.",Château Pierre-Bise,France,95,60,Chenin Blanc
104521,Wayfarer 2014 Wayfarer Vineyard Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),"Crafted from 12 different clones planted throughout the estate vineyard, farmed to perfection, this is a delicious and exuberant expression of blueberry crumble that's succulent and inviting in every way.

104522,Three Sticks 2014 Durell Vineyard Origin Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"This is a beautiful display of Durell's greatness, crafted from two blocks of the vineyard, one planted to Old Wente, the other in one of the site's most rocky and windy areas. Combined, it offers well-integrated notions of golden apple, pear and honey amidst a freshness of acidity and unobtrusive oak, just the slightest suggestion of nutmeg-dusted brioche on the finish.",Three Sticks,US,95,48,Chardonnay
104523,Giacomo Conterno 2011 Francia (Barolo),"Roberto Conterno didn't make his flagship Monfortino in this vintage so he blended the juice destined for this iconic wine into Francia. It opens with enticing aromas of dark berry, underbrush, baking spice, mineral and a balsamic note that carry over to the powerful palate, along with juicy raspberry, licorice and tobacco. It's big and structured but also shows balance and complexity. Drink 2019–2029.",Giacomo Conterno,Italy,95,225,Nebbiolo

104526,Chanin 2014 Los Alamos Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Gavin Chanin is expert at showing off individual vineyards, which is most evident in this bottling from a less iconic, larger site. Baked cherry, allspice, raw beef and light bay leaf show on the nose, while the palate carries ripe strawberry and a red-cherry core surrounded by zesty thyme, dill, mint and a touch of green olive. The light yet grippy texture is stunning.",Chanin,US,95,50,Pinot Noir
104527,Château de Fesles 2011 Vin Rare (Bonnezeaux),"From the appellation that is at a summit of Loire sweet wines, this golden wine balances intense acidity with intense botrytis and honey flavors.

104530,Wood Family Vineyards 2010 Muy Bueno Zinfandel (Livermore Valley),"Tasting quite sweet and soft, like a raspberry liqueur, this high-alcohol Zinfandel is wrapped in vanilla and cinnamon tones and would be difficult to pair with anything beyond barbecue.",Wood Family Vineyards,US,82,32,Zinfandel
104531,Kaleidos 2008 Osiris Red (Paso Robles),"This blend is based on Grenache. It has white sugar, raspberry, caramel and spice flavors that finish as luscious as a candy bar.",Kaleidos,US,82,32,Rhône-style Red Blend
104532,Kenneth Volk 2010 Pomar Junction Vineyard Touriga Nacional (Paso Robles),"This variety is one of the traditional Port grapes. It should do well as a dry wine in the hotter areas of California, but no one has figured out how to make it happen. This bottling by Kenneth Voik does not advance the cause. The wine is heavy and dull.",Kenneth Volk,US,82,36,Touriga Nacional
104533,Finca Albret 2011 Rosado Garnacha (Navarra),"This barrel-fermented rosé is flat and smells more like apple juice than wine. Despite showing some tang, this is dull in the mouth, with bland orange and nectarine flavors. On the finish, it's washed out and has an iodine-like aftertaste.",Finca Albret,Spain,82,11,Garnacha
104534,"Truett Hurst 2011 Eden Ridge, Barrel Select Chardonnay (Mendocino County)","Simple and tasting of vanilla toffee, this Chardonnay, value-priced for sure, has a finish that's puckeringly sweet.",Truett Hurst,US,82,11,Chardonnay

104537,Gary Farrell 2010 Ramal Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Tastes a little vegetal and simple, with cherry jam, asparagus and sweet oak flavors. Not a success, and a particular disappointment compared to the winery's other 2010 single-vineyard Pinots.",Gary Farrell,US,82,50,Pinot Noir
104538,Hess Select 2010 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"This is a pretty ordinary Pinot Noir that's dry and brisk in acidity, with thinned-down cherry skin, pomegranate and cola flavors. Loses a point for some bitterness in the finish.",Hess Select,US,82,20,Pinot Noir
104539,Pedroncelli 2012 friends.white White (Sonoma County),"Soft, rich and simple, with flavors of lemondrop candy and vanilla.",Pedroncelli,US,82,12,White Blend
104540,Quarticello NV Ferrando (Lambrusco dell'Emilia),"Part of the natural wine movement, this frizzy Lambrusco opens with a dark raspberry color and easy aromas of cassis, sour cherry and chopped mint. The foamy close is easy and thin.",Quarticello,Italy,82,21,Lambrusco

104543,Château de Piote 2012 Red (Bordeaux Clairet),"Bordeaux Claret has a darker color than a rosé, suggesting more weight. This wine, though, also has a green herbal edge that is less attractive.",Château de Piote,France,82,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
104544,Costa Archi 2010 Assiolo (Sangiovese di Romagna Superiore),Assiolo is a slightly tart and bitter expression of Sangiovese with sharp aromas of cherry fruit and plum. The tannins show an astringent and nervous quality.,Costa Archi,Italy,82,21,Sangiovese
104545,Amador Cellars 2006 Westside Vineyard Zinfandel (Amador County),"Earthy and very tight after aging 20 months in barrel and another two years in bottle prior to release, this wine's fruit is slipping away, leaving behind only a pruney sourness.",Amador Cellars,US,81,25,Zinfandel
104546,Green Truck 2010 Petite Sirah (Mendocino County),"Made from organic grapes, Green Truck's Petite has not a lot going on aromatically and exhibits very little in the way of the variety's profile, tasting like generic red wine.",Green Truck,US,81,14,Petite Sirah
104547,Brochelle Vineyards 2010 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Way too ripe, with the flavors veering into raisins. The alcohol, which is 15.6% abv, really sticks out.",Brochelle Vineyards,US,81,32,Zinfandel
104548,Château Larroque 2012 Red (Bordeaux Rosé),"Intensely acidic wine, its red fruits and caramel hidden behind a tart, over-lemoned flavor. For lovers of mouth-shockingly dry rosé. Screwcap.",Château Larroque,France,81,12,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
104549,Cornellana 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Cachapoal Valley),"Rubbery, mulchy aromas never clean up and rank as rough. Roughness describes the palate, too, while flavors of herbal fruit, bitterness, hard spices and buttery oak fail to come around.",Cornellana,Chile,81,10,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
104550,Harlow Ridge 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"A very basic Cabernet Sauvignon, very low in alcohol, with a harshness on the finish.",Harlow Ridge,US,81,11,Cabernet Sauvignon
104551,Harlow Ridge 2011 Chardonnay (Lodi),"This bargain-priced wine is oaky and bland, with a smell of menthol.",Harlow Ridge,US,81,11,Chardonnay
104552,Green Truck 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),"A Lake County SB with very little in the way of aromatics. It's acceptable for everyday, but a generic white wine.",Green Truck,US,81,14,Sauvignon Blanc
104553,Dominio de Eguren 2011 Protocolo Rosé (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"This is no longer in its prime. It tastes weird, mealy and slightly exotic, while the palate feels rubbery. Nectarine and plum notes are detectable on a strained finish.",Dominio de Eguren,Spain,81,7,Rosé
104554,Vinum 2010 Pinot Noir (California),"Soft, dull and vegetal. Still, it's drinkable for some modest cola flavors and velvety mouthfeel.",Vinum,US,81,14,Pinot Noir
104555,William Cole 2011 Albamar Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),"This is edgy and lean, with mulch and latex on a stripped back nose. In the mouth, it clangs around due to racy acidity. Flavors of leafy red fruits and citrus are not fully convincing.",William Cole,Chile,81,13,Pinot Noir
104556,Bodegas 1898 2009 Ramón Roqueta Garnacha (Catalunya),"This reedy, strained Garnacha features cheesy aromas, stalky fruit and chemical notes. The palate is hard in feel, with a weedy, burnt aftertaste.",Bodegas 1898,Spain,81,12,Garnacha
104557,Fattoria Giuseppe Savini 2011 Rondineto Merlot (Colli Aprutini),"There's a thorny, almost raw quality of fruit here that is backed by a touch of dill weed and black tar. It feels tart and slightly bitter on the close.",Fattoria Giuseppe Savini,Italy,80,12,Merlot
104558,Paul Cheneau NV Demi Sec Sparkling (Cava),"With dusty, candied aromas, the bouquet on this semisweet Cava is scattered all over the map. In the mouth, it's inoffensive, however the wine's candied, melony flavors are cloying and overtly sugary. This is too clumsy and candied to be taken seriously.",Paul Cheneau,Spain,80,14,Sparkling Blend
104559,Eguren 2015 Viura (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Dry lime and citrus peel aromas are round and solid, nothing more. That more or less describes the palate, which tastes a little bit wheaty and dull, with a note of bitter melon on the finish. Drink now.",Eguren,Spain,85,7,Viura
104560,Quinta do Castelinho 2013 Quinta Dona Mafalda Vinhas Velhas Red (Douro),This wine offers very ripe fruit that gives an almost-sweet character to what should be a dry wine. There is acidity that helps. Drink now.,Quinta do Castelinho,Portugal,85,23,Portuguese Red
104561,Rock Point 2014 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This single vineyard cuvée is quite light, yet retains your interest with a thin dusting of cocoa and ground coffee around the tangy berry fruit. It's a bit earthy, but a pleasant quaffer, along the lines of a generic Bourgogne.",Rock Point,US,85,17,Pinot Noir
104562,Jose Maria Vieira 2014 Borges Quinta da Soalheira Red (Douro),"This is an easy, fruity wine. Soft and light in character, it has attractive red fruits and acidity. Drink this wine now.",Jose Maria Vieira,Portugal,85,8,Portuguese Red

104565,Martin Ranch 2013 Thérèse Vineyards Dos Niñas Vineyard Syrah (Santa Clara Valley),"The nose on this bottling is classic for the grape: blackberry, dried lilacs, wet asphalt, beef char and black rocks. The palate is more muddled, with flavors of clay and freshly turned earth, without much spice or fruit to note.",Martin Ranch,US,85,29,Syrah
104566,Weisinger 2013 Estate Tempranillo (Rogue Valley),"The wine was aged in 30% new American oak, and has modest cherry fruit with astringent tannins. There's an underlying earthy flavor, leading into a chalky finish.",Weisinger,US,85,32,Tempranillo

104569,Illuminati Dino 2010 Pieluni Riserva (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Colline Teramane),"Aromas of steeped prune and raspberry jam mix with a note of used leather and chopped herb. The robust but evolved palate offers dried sour cherry, raisin, ground pepper and espresso alongside the heat of evident alcohol. Grainy tannins leave a bracing finish. The fruit has almost dried up completely so drink sooner rather than later.",Illuminati Dino,Italy,85,60,Montepulciano
104570,Viñalba 2014 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Valle de Uco),"Damp earthy berry aromas are a touch murky. This feels bulky, grabby and tannic, while overriding flavors of coffee, toast and bitter chocolate make fruit a bit player. A choppy finish with hard tannins and herbal berry flavors puts this Cabernet in the midtier category.",Viñalba,Argentina,85,15,Cabernet Sauvignon
104571,Covila 2015 Adivino Tinto Joven (Rioja),"Fiery cherry cough-drop aromas are basic at best, crude at worst. Bright and wiry in feel, this tastes of medicinal red fruits.",Covila,Spain,85,11,Tempranillo
104572,Adega Mãe 2014 Chardonnay (Lisboa),"With light wood-aging flavors, this creamy wine is still young, with tangy orange and lemon zest as well as touches of vanilla. Let it develop further and drink from late 2017.",Adega Mãe,Portugal,85,17,Chardonnay
104573,Adega Mãe 2014 Viognier (Lisboa),"This is a wood-fermented wine, spicy and lightly perfumed. The wood aging does dominate the yellow fruits and acidity that still need time. Drink this wine from late 2017.",Adega Mãe,Portugal,85,17,Viognier
104574,Barba 2013 I Vasari Old Vines (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),"Aromas of French oak and coconut lead the nose. Oak carries over to the lean, bracing palate where you'll also detect raw sour cherry. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak while raspy tannins leave an astringent, mouth puckering finish.",Barba,Italy,85,25,Montepulciano
104575,Beacon Hill 2015 Riesling,"This is dry, almost sour, despite its low alcohol, and feels disjointed. Along with the sour citrus flavor is a conflicting streak of too-ripe fruit. Interesting components, but they may or may not knit together with more bottle age.",Beacon Hill,US,85,22,Riesling
104576,Casa Ferreirinha 2015 Esteva Red (Douro),"This wine is ripe, fruity and balanced. It has red-berry flavors along with acidity and a bright aftertaste. Drink from 2019",Casa Ferreirinha,Portugal,85,10,Portuguese Red
104577,Casa Santos Lima 2015 Gewurztraminer (Lisboa),"This is a typically perfumed Gewürztraminer with the twist of a cool ocean climate. That coolness allows plenty of acidity to come into this dry, fruity wine and adds a floral character. With its crispness, it is bright as well as aromatic. Drink now.",Casa Santos Lima,Portugal,85,,Gewürztraminer
104578,Château de Birot 2015 Bordeaux Blanc,"The Birot estate is in Cadillac, the fortress town on the banks of the Garonne. This classic Sauvignon and Sémillon blend is herbal, green and grassy.

104582,Quinta do Filoco 2011 Reserva Red (Douro),"Strong tannins dominate this wine. It comes from a good vintage, but it is quite extracted. It could soften, although it may remain a tough wine.",Quinta do Filoco,Portugal,85,,Portuguese Red
104583,Quinta dos Poços 2014 Grande Reserva Red (Douro),"The tannins dominate this wine, giving a hard-edged character. It is firm but without the fruit weight to support it.",Quinta dos Poços,Portugal,85,26,Portuguese Red
104584,Sanguinhal 2013 Casabel Red (Lisboa),"This soft, wine is full of ripe black-currant flavors. It is smooth and rounded, with a touch of wood and plenty of acidity. Drink now.",Sanguinhal,Portugal,85,,Portuguese Red
104585,South Stage 2010 Alchemy Red (Rogue Valley),"This six-year-old wine is 40% Tempranillo, 40% Carmenère and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. The Carmenère dominates, pushing stiff, tannic, stemmy flavors into the core. It's not in danger of aging too quickly, but the tannins seem unlikely to soften.",South Stage,US,85,32,Red Blend
104586,Villa Giada 2015 Suri (Moscato d'Asti),"This frothy wine offers aromas of cut grass, hay and chopped herb. The aromas carry over to the sweet simple palate along with ripe apricot and a confectionery note.",Villa Giada,Italy,85,,Moscato
104587,Manzwine 2015 Rosé (Lisboa),"Made from Castelão grapes, this crisp wine has red fruits that burst out of the glass and give a lively aftertaste, with tight acidity. Drink now.",Manzwine,Portugal,85,12,Rosé
104588,Messias 2014 Selection Red (Bairrada),"This ripe blend holds 80% Baga, with the rest Merlot. The Merlot softens the firmer tannins of the Baga, giving the wine its red-fruit character with a juicy aftertaste. Drink the wine now.",Messias,Portugal,85,9,Portuguese Red
104589,Palacio de Fefiñanes 2009 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"One of the most cutting, acid-intense Albariños out there. The nose in minerally and tight as a drum, with green melon and green apple scents. The palate is razor sharp and driving, with tangy, high-toned lemon and Granny Smith apple flavors. Totally citric and zesty; it will last another few years.",Palacio de Fefiñanes,Spain,87,26,Albariño
104590,Perception 2008 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This rich, oaky Chardonnay has aromas and flavors of buttered toast, buttered popcorn, vanilla and pineapple jam. It's very rich and creamy, and appeals for sheer deliciouness.",Perception,US,87,38,Chardonnay
104591,Qupé 2008 Syrah (Central Coast),"Shows the classy elegance of all Qupe's Syrahs, although it's thinner and rougher than the more expensive bottlings. Still, for the price, this wine is nicely dry and intricate in blackberry and crushed pepper flavors.",Qupé,US,87,18,Syrah
104592,Ridge 2008 York Creek Zinfandel (California),"A bit thin and acidic, but charming for its dryness and firm tannins, which call for rich, marbled beef. The pepper-inspired blackberry and cassis flavors are fine. Not an ager, but will benefit from a few hours of decanting.",Ridge,US,87,30,Zinfandel
104593,Sanguis 2006 Waxing Poetic Syrah (California),"Made from 100% Syrah and aged in 100% new French oak, this wine is currently hard, astringent and oaky, with caramel, vanilla and buttered toast aromas and flavors.

104594,Santa Sofia 2007 Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso,"Aged in large oak casks, this fresh Ripasso makes good use of minimal wood intervention that comes forth as light spice and cinnamon.

104595,Sartori 2006 Vigneti di Montegradella (Valpolicella Classico Superiore),"Vigneti di Montegradella is a well-priced Valpolicella with more intensity and density than you'd expect. In fact, the wine offers determination and personality with enough natural extraction to pair with bean soup or barbecued hamburgers.",Sartori,Italy,87,14,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
104596,Scott Family 2008 Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco),"This is a fresh, lively Pinot Noir for drinking now. It's elegantly silky and dry, with crisp acids and pure flavors of cherries, cola, spices and oak. A touch of oak adds smoky richness.",Scott Family,US,87,39,Pinot Noir
104597,St. Francis 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Good price for a nicely complex Cabernet for drinking now. Dry and smooth in tannins, it shows ripe blackberry, cherry, licorice and herb flavors, with a kiss of oak.",St. Francis,US,87,22,Cabernet Sauvignon
104598,Allegrini 2008 Corte Giara (Valpolicella Ripasso),"In the past, Allegrini adopted a vocal stand against Ripasso (a middle ground wine between Amarone and Valpolicella) and for this reason Corte Giara Ripasso comes as a big surprise. Despite the controversy, this historic producer presents a very acceptable wine with pretty tones of sweet spice and bright berry.",Allegrini,Italy,87,20,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
104599,Arger-Martucci 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A shade off the 2005, being leaner and more tannic, and more akin to the 2001. It's a dry, taut Cab, marked by a drying astringency accompanying the blackberry and mineral flavors. Drink now–2012.",Arger-Martucci,US,87,40,Cabernet Sauvignon
104600,Arrowood 2008 Saralee's Vineyard Viognier (Russian River Valley),"This 100% Viognier shows the variety's exotic side, with delicious tropical fruit, citrus, pear, melon, lychee and smoky oak flavors.

104601,Atwater 2008 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Hints of smoke and wet stone combine with sweet Granny Smith apple and stonefruit aromas on the nose of this inviting dry Riesling. Smoke seeps through on the palate as well, melding with brighter flavors like orange peel and underripe tangerine, making for a refreshing yet deeply compelling sip.",Atwater,US,87,16,Riesling
104602,Atwater 2008 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"Though richly perfumed with rose petals and elderflower, the flowery aromatics are reined in by bright lemon and citrus peel notes.

104603,Autonom 2007 Law of Proportions Syrah (California),"The components of this wine are all over the place, with blackberry and currant fruit, 100% new oak, brisk tannins and acidity needing to come together for harmony. Whether or not they will is a guess. Right now it's rustic, but dry and complex enough to drink after a good decant.",Autonom,US,87,38,Syrah
104604,Beringer 2007 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Quite good and rich in jammy berry, cherry, cassis and oak flavors, but there's a certain obvious appeal that lacks complexity, and it's not what you expect from a wine of this reputation and price. This bottling has been falling off from the glories of the 1990s for some years now. A pity. Hopefully the trend will reverse. Production was 9,008 cases.",Beringer,US,87,115,Cabernet Sauvignon
104605,Bodegas Tarima 2009 Monastrell (Jumilla),"Rubbery and roasted, but not too much so. Otherwise one should look for medicinal berry aromas followed by flavors of baked plum, prune and black pepper. The finish is dense, a touch flat, and chocolaty; overall this is a chunky, sweet performer.",Bodegas Tarima,Spain,87,8,Monastrell
104606,Château Grande Cassagne 2008 Grenache-Syrah (Costières de Nîmes),"A blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah, this is another example of the fine values coming out of the Costières de Nîmes. It's a medium-bodied wine with a velvety texture and a fine balance between herbs and raspberry fruit on the one hand and dark berries and earth on the other. Drink it over the next 2–3 years.",Château Grande Cassagne,France,87,12,Grenache-Syrah
104607,Cono Sur 2009 Visión Gewürztraminer (Casablanca Valley),"A highly aromatic wine. Lychee is the prime scent along with white flowers, and the palate is oily but right, with lychee, ginger, spice and orange flavors. Plump but short on the finish, but clean as a whole. Very nice for Chilean Gewürz.",Cono Sur,Chile,87,13,Gewürztraminer
104608,Corteforte 2007 Podere Bertarole Ripassato (Valpolicella Classico Superiore),"A drying mineral note of slate or graphite runs through the middle of this plush and rich red Ripassato wine from Valpolicella. Background notes of spice and cherry cola come through as well, especially in the mouth where the wine boats a soft, compact feel. Pair this wine with lamb or light beef dishes.",Corteforte,Italy,87,25,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara"
104609,Degani 2008 Cicilio (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),"Ripasso Cicilio shines bright with personality and freshness.

104611,Domaine Nicolas Boiron 2008 Red (Côtes du Rhône),"From the family behind Bosquet des Papes in Châteauneuf, this is a solid Côtes du Rhône, with modest tannins but decent structure and typical notes of leather, dried cherries, chocolate and cinnamon. Drink it over the next few years.",Domaine Nicolas Boiron,France,87,16,Rhône-style Red Blend
104612,Dominio de Tares 2007 Baltos Mencía (Bierzo),"Beefy, stocky aromas also bring herb, tomato and berry notes.

Medium in size, with level tannins and a juicy, good overall feel to it.",Dominio de Tares,Spain,87,17,Mencía
104613,Finca Allende 2008 Blanco White (Rioja),"Yellow-gold in color, with baked fruit, butterscotch, creamed corn and wood resin aromas. Forcefully oaked and massive in the mouth, with enough sporty acidity to prop up the woodspice, nutmeg and resiny flavors that render the fruit secondary. Much like chewing on an oak plank, structured and layered.",Finca Allende,Spain,87,35,White Blend
104614,Genium Celler 2006 Ecològic Red (Priorat),"Slightly fiery and hot on the nose, but there's enough berry, cherry and dusty leather to keep it positive.

104617,Korta 2009 Viognier-Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay White (Lontué Valley),"A lively, surprising bargain made from Viognier, Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay. That it costs merely $8 makes the melon and apple aromas and flavors all the better. Citrusy as it evolves, and clean throughout, with no wavering. A very nice white quaffing wine.",Korta,Chile,87,8,White Blend
104618,Luigi Righetti 2007 Capitel de' Roari (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"Amarone Capitel de' Roari delivers a crisp, lean expression that showcases Valpolicella winemaking tradition.

104619,Francesco Rinaldi 2013 Cannubi (Barolo),"New leather, pressed rose, violet, baking spice and crushed herb are just some of the aromas you'll find in this textbook Barolo.

104652,Château Kirwan 2008 Barrel sample (Margaux),"88-90 Barrel sample. Caramel new wood aromas are followed by spice and toast flavors. The fruit seems thin by comparison, hard to feel under all that polished toast.",Château Kirwan,France,89,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
104653,Château Latour-Martillac 2008 Barrel sample (Pessac-Léognan),"88-90 Barrel sample. A dark hued wine, with its tense tannins giving a strong backbone to the dry, firm structure. The fruit hardly shows through all this dry, extracted character.",Château Latour-Martillac,France,89,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
104654,Vietti 2003 Tre Vigne (Barbera d'Asti),"Representing four generations of winemaking, Vietti makes a strong show with this intense and vibrant ruby colored wine.

104655,Château Bourgneuf-Vayron 2006 Barrel sample (Pomerol),"88—90 Barrel sample. A wine with a high wood content, maybe too much – the question is over the fruit's ability to stand up to the blast of wood. The result is a wine that is super-spicy.",Château Bourgneuf-Vayron,France,89,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
104656,Château Haut-Bergey 2006 Barrel sample (Pessac-Léognan),"88—90 Barrel sample. Firm and dry, here is a wine that still offers plenty of ripe fruits. There are good blackcurrant flavors, along with the dry tannins that are as much wood as fruit driven.",Château Haut-Bergey,France,89,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
104657,Château Lafleur-Gazin 2006 Barrel sample (Pomerol),"88—90 Barrel sample. Somewhat lean, more of solid tannin than fruit. But there is also some fresh acidity.",Château Lafleur-Gazin,France,89,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
104658,Backsberg 2003 Babylons Toren Red (Paarl),"This blend features aromas of vanilla, sweet tobacco and cherry followed by big, masculine flavors of cassis, raspberry, tobacco and cedar.

104659,Pulenta Estate 2008 La Flor Malbec (Mendoza),"Bold and earthy wine, with aromas of fine rubber, balsam wood, forest floor, spice and ripe black fruit. It's thick as it rolls over the palate, and the wild berry, herb and pepper flavors fit the wine's physique and profile. Long and fairly deep on the finish; drink now through 2011.",Pulenta Estate,Argentina,89,16,Malbec
104660,Stark-Condé 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch),"This is an interesting Cabernet because of its balance of rich, plush fruit and exotic, plucky spice. The nose offers cloves, pepper and mocha, and on the palate, flavors of smoke, cracked pepper and plum are inviting. A stylish sip with aging potential.",Stark-Condé,South Africa,89,27,Cabernet Sauvignon
104661,Château Bouscaut 2006 Barrel sample (Pessac-Léognan),"88—90 Barrel sample. Very sweet, ripe, rounded, with almost tropical richness, layered with lychees and spice.",Château Bouscaut,France,89,,Bordeaux-style White Blend

104666,Château Croizet-Bages 2008 Barrel sample (Pauillac),"88-90 Barrel sample. A ripe, fruity wine, showing delicious fresh berries, lively acidity over solid tannins. This is a wine on the charming side, maybe lacking intensity, but a pleasure to taste.",Château Croizet-Bages,France,89,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
104667,Château Ferrière 2008 Barrel sample (Margaux),"88-90 Barrel sample. With its minty aroma and high proportion of new wood, this is a wine which shows polish, a smooth, wood-laden texture offering a wine that will probably age quickly.",Château Ferrière,France,89,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
104668,Klinker Brick 2007 Farráh Syrah (Lodi),"There are delicious flavors in this ripe Syrah, and while it's too soft for comfort, it sure is nice to drink.

104670,42°S NV Brut Méthode Traditionelle Sparkling Wine (Tasmania),"Delicate and light-bodied with plenty to love in the nose, including irresistible notes of bread dough, strawberry and lemon which turn to fresh cherries in the mouth. The finish is focused and very crisp—just a few paces short of tart, actually. This wine screams for raw oysters.",42°S,Australia,89,20,Champagne Blend
104671,Pine & Brown 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Three vineyards contribute to this lovely wine, two in Rutherford, both certified organic, and another in Soda Canyon which is at 800-feet in elevation. Red and blue fruit open for leather and a touch of cedar and dried herb—the wine ultimately elegant and Old World. The tannin weight is substantial but never distracting.",Pine & Brown,US,91,75,Cabernet Sauvignon
104672,Point & Line 2014 Vogelzang Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"Quite light in aroma at first, this is a delicate, lithe and lovely bottling, showing lemon and yellow pear tones on the nose. That sensibility carries to the palate, where touches of yellow apple, sea salt, faint banana and a shred of bubblegum converge for a complete yet restrained white wine experience.",Point & Line,US,91,25,Sauvignon Blanc
104673,Schloss Johannisberger 2014 Rotlack Kabinett Feinherb Riesling (Rheingau),"Fresh grapefruit, lime and lemon collide in this invigorating waterfall of citrus flavors.

104674,Sequoia Grove 2012 Cambium Red (Napa Valley),"The producer's flagship wine, this vintage blends Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.

104675,Skinner 2013 Mourvèdre (El Dorado),"Different and intriguing, this tightly wound wine has white pepper aromas, tart cherry and raspberry flavors and an engaging, astringent mouthfeel. High in acidity and relatively low in body, it has a vibrancy and restraint that will benefit from more time in the bottle. Best after 2019.",Skinner,US,91,26,Mourvèdre
104676,Sokol Blosser 2013 Goosepen Block Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Single block wines, such as this one, often show a tight focus rather than a broad palate. Here it works well, wrapping savory notes around red currant fruit. There's a lightly metallic ring to the flavors, running straight through the finish. Give this a few hours of decanting, or tuck it away for drinking after 2020.",Sokol Blosser,US,91,80,Pinot Noir
104677,Gros Ventre 2013 Baranoff Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Farmed by the vineyard manager who owns Small Vines, another small Pinot Noir producer, this is a complex, well-crafted wine, high in acidity and high-toned red fruit, like cranberry, pomegranate and cherry, with a wisp of orange peel on their heels.

104679,Joh. Jos. Prüm 2014 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"While subdued and closed off at initial tasting, time and aeration seem to bring out this wine's vibrant tangerine and apricot perfume. The spry palate is delicately sweet, juxtaposing fresh, primary stone fruit and lime flavors against a backdrop of savory earth and nut. It's a quiet wine that should gain power and depth with maturity. Hold until 2020.",Joh. Jos. Prüm,Germany,91,29,Riesling
104680,Johannishof 2014 Rüdesheimer Berg Rottland Spätlese Riesling (Rheingau),"Pristine, primary tangerine and grapefruit flavors shine brilliantly throughout this crisp, light-footed Spätlese.

104681,King Estate 2014 Antiquum Vineyards Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Refined and complex, this limited-production, vineyard-designate wine starts with lemony acidity, but there's much more to discover as it bores down through the palate. Meyer lemons, grapefruit and nectarines are in the mix, with refreshing minerality.",King Estate,US,91,24,Pinot Gris
104682,Kokomo 2015 Grenache Rosé (North Coast),"Pretty in jasmine, lemon and orange, this is a crisp, dry and lovely wine, integrated with just enough heft on the body and a surprisingly deft length on the finish. Stock up for gatherings.",Kokomo,US,91,18,Rosé
104683,Palacios Remondo 2011 Propiedad (Rioja),"Closed and in need of air at first, this takes on a ripe, medicinal, almost candied red-fruit nose.

104684,Lang & Reed 2013 Two-Fourteen Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"Named for a Loire Valley clone, this New World wine aspires to an Old World sensibility and achieves it in its floral invitation and bright, peppery overtones.

104685,Lucienne 2013 Lone Oak Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Clean aromas of honeysuckle converge with richer, rounded components of Asian pear, coconut and pineapple on the nose of this single vineyard expression.

104686,MacPhail 2013 The Flyer Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Let this burly, big-boned beauty open to fully enjoy its robust oak and fistfuls of black cherry, the oak showing in terms of toasty, slightly reductive aromas. A smooth texture keeps the wine flowing along a concentrated highway of power and ripeness.",MacPhail,US,91,59,Pinot Noir
104687,Michael David 2013 Freakshow Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"This wine is a bold but well-mannered blockbuster that serves generous helpings of dark color, spicy aromas, concentrated flavors and a luxurious dry texture.

104688,Navarro 2014 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This medium-bodied wine has a compelling blend of restraint and power. It offers modest, fruity aromas at first, then nice tart fruit flavors that start off lean and soon expand exponentially in the mouth before tapering off elegantly on the finish. With little oak flavor in the way, it gives pure Pinot sophistication.",Navarro,US,91,20,Pinot Noir
104689,Occasio 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"This wine is agile and elegant, very firm in texture without being too full-bodied. It smells lightly smoky, slightly herbal and tastes moderately rich as subtle plum and pomegranate flavors transition to richer berry and cocoa notes on the finish. It needs time to show more complexity, so drink after 2020.",Occasio,US,91,40,Cabernet Sauvignon
104690,Pali 2014 Huntington Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Another stunning deal on this annual bottling, this wine is jammy and fruity on the nose with buttered cherries and berry jam, yet layered with baking spice and wet clay minerality.

104694,Soquel Vineyards 2013 Library Selection Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Rounded strawberry, orange peel, tart black raspberry and a touch of juniper pop on the nose of this appellation blend by members of the pioneering Bargetto family. Black plum skins, crushed slate, raspberry juice and fresh-picked thyme show on the palate.",Soquel Vineyards,US,91,40,Pinot Noir
104695,Starmont 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Floral, pretty and light, this wine was made for porch sitting and all-around relaxing. It never gives up on fruit and complexity, offering a medium body and vibrant acidity around the rose-petaled texture. This is a lovely sipper.",Starmont,US,91,19,Pinot Noir
104696,Stephen Ross 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"The slightest shade of yellowish pink, this wine is a great study of fresh acidity and compelling texture in a rosé. Very slight and soft strawberry and squeezed lemon aromas kick off the experience, followed by light red fruit sliced by tangy kumquat on the palate. The flavors are not particularly complex or unique, but the sip is fascinating.",Stephen Ross,US,91,24,Pinot Noir
104697,Stoller 2015 Pinot Noir Rosé (Dundee Hills),"Though pale in hue, this is big in flavor. It's a textbook Pinot Noir rosé, sharp, tight and showing deep flavors of rhubarb, rosewater and strawberry fruit. There's exceptional length along with the lovely, fresh fruit flavors.",Stoller,US,91,25,Rosé
104698,Stonehedge 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"This is a lovely, full-bodied expression of apple blossom aromas, just-ripe pear and orange Creamsicle, a balanced mix of rich and sublime that remains smooth and silky on the palate with a lingering finish.",Stonehedge,US,91,35,Chardonnay
104699,Bodegas Landaluce 2012 Fincas Landaluce Crianza (Rioja),"Fresh, pure berry aromas don't mess around. This fruit-forward Crianza is mouth-filling and borders on lush.

104700,Bodegas Palacio 2012 Cosme Palacio Vendimia Seleccionada (Rioja),"This Crianza is strapping on the nose, with fairly big but not overdone black-fruit aromas. A ripe, chewy palate with moderate tannins holds peppery wild berry flavors that settle on plum. A dark, toasty, peppery finish is mild and smooth. Overall, this offers a lot to like.",Bodegas Palacio,Spain,91,20,Tempranillo
104701,Benoît Daridan 2014 Pinot Noir-Gamay (Cheverny),"Dominated by Pinot Noir, this is a tight and stalky wine. It is almost too light, with its acidity and tight tannins to the front. Probably as it softens it will round out, so wait until late 2016 to drink.",Benoît Daridan,France,87,18,Pinot Noir-Gamay
104702,Benoît Daridan 2014 Rosé (Cheverny),"Made from Pinot Noir, this fresh and light rosé is packed with red berries and lively acidity. It is perfumed, dry and very fruity. Drink now.",Benoît Daridan,France,87,18,Rosé

104704,Coeur de Terre 2013 Oregon Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Scents softly suggest rose petals and milk chocolate, leading into a wine that seems to hit a hard stop midpalate. A clear flavor of cold steel resonates against a counterpoint of tart berry fruit.",Coeur de Terre,US,87,22,Pinot Noir
104705,Cummins Road 2012 Pinot Noir,"A hint of sweat in the nose blows away to reveal a solid core of cherry fruit, along with broad flavors of stem, coffee and earth. This wine is substantial, though that slightly funky character lingers into the finish.",Cummins Road,US,87,25,Pinot Noir
104706,Il Falchetto 2013 Bricco Paradiso (Barbera d'Asti Superiore),"Warm and full-bodied, this opens with aromas of espresso, fig, dried berry, toasted oak and clove.

104708,Leonard Kreusch 2014 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),"Saffron and orange blossoms perfume this intensely ripe, almost honey-slick Kabinett.

104712,Raiza 2013 Crianza (Rioja),"Aromas of Middle Eastern spices, pencil eraser, oak grain, red plum and cherry make for a complete nose. This Tempranillo offers good body and a fair amount of oak on the palate along with spicy plum fruit that tastes more oaky and lactic on the finish.",Raiza,Spain,87,12,Tempranillo
104713,Mount Veeder 2012 Reserve Red (Mount Veeder),"This wine is made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, with tiny additions of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot.

104716,Peter Nicolay 2014 Ürziger Goldwingert Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"Slightly oxidized tones of pressed apple and pear are lifted by a shock of lemony acidity in this spry semi-dry Riesling.

104717,Podere Ruggeri Corsini 2012 Armujan (Barbera d'Alba),"Aromas of mature plum, espresso, coconut and toasted oak lead the nose. The firm palate offers fig, blackberry jam, licorice and roasted coffee bean alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. The fruit is starting to dry up so drink sooner rather than later.",Podere Ruggeri Corsini,Italy,87,28,Barbera
104718,Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo 2011 Pomares Red (Douro),This is a solid mineral and tannin dominated wine. It has black currant fruits which are still buried by the tense tannins and stalky texture. It therefore needs some time to develop and broaden out. Drink from 2018.,Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo,Portugal,87,15,Portuguese Red
104719,Rodney Strong 2014 Rosé of Malbec (Sonoma County),"This wine comes from Alexander Valley-grown Malbec, a variety the producer has been planting in earnest over the last few years.

104720,Silvan Ridge 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Anchored in fig, plum and berry fruit, this is a substantial effort for both the vintage and the price. It will show best with hearty, cold-weather dishes. Hints of cinnamon and chocolate extend the finish.",Silvan Ridge,US,87,20,Pinot Noir

104722,Terras de Alter 2014 Terra d'Alter White (Alentejano),"This is an attractive, perfumed wine that is a blend of Síria, Arinto and Viognier.

104723,Schmitt Söhne 2014 Relax Riesling (Mosel),"Freshly snipped thyme and bramble notes are prominent, yet unobtrusive against a backdrop of honey-kissed lemon and lime in this brisk off-dry Riesling. It's a zesty sprightly wine to drink young.",Schmitt Söhne,Germany,87,10,Riesling

104728,Ledger David 2013 Malbec (Rogue Valley),"This estate-grown effort is almost jet black, and scented with tar, smoke and black fruits. It's dense beyond dense, and completely shut down. Even after aeration, decanting, and hours of breathing time, it remained stubbornly closed. Brief hints of tobacco and earth, cassis and coffee suggest that with more bottle age, this one could really blossom.",Ledger David,US,87,30,Malbec
104729,Liberated 2013 Pinot Noir (Monterey County),"Black cherry, chipped slate and an earthy nutmeg character show on the nose of this stylishly labeled bottling. Medium in weight, it offers energetic and tart cranberry-cherry flavors as well as a menthol element on the palate, which is tangy throughout and wipes up clean.",Liberated,US,87,20,Pinot Noir
104730,Fiuza 2014 3 Castas Red (Tejo),"The wine is young, still more structure than fruit. It has firm tannins as well as juicy blackberry fruits.

104732,Canoe Ridge 1998 Reserve Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A much more concentrated version of the regular bottling. The fruit is still raspberries and cherries, but there is more focus and power, and it’s wrapped in smooth milk chocolate. A flat-out delicious bottle of Merlot.",Canoe Ridge,US,90,45,Merlot
104733,Kunde 1998 C.S. Ridge Vineyard Chardonnay (California),"From the highest (at 1,000 feet) of the Kunde's vineyards, it's lavishly oaked, with aromas of butterscotch, spice and custard; also nutty and creamy notes. Marked by intense tropical fruit aromas and oriental spices, it also tastes very rich. It's the best of a very good trio of limited-production Chardonnay wines.",Kunde,US,90,20,Chardonnay
104734,Signorello 1998 Hope's Cuvée Chardonnay (California),"This massively oaky wine smells like an explosion in a spice factory, with ginger, cinnamon, clove and nutmeg aromas, accented by vanilla, brown sugar, butterscotch and honey. Somewhere in there is some ripe tropical fruit. Enormous and full-bodied, it's a dense, unctuous wine.",Signorello,US,90,60,Chardonnay
104735,Chateau Ste. Michelle 1997 Late Harvest Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Harvested at a lip-smacking 42.5° brix, this seductive wine explodes on the palate with bright grapefruit and citrus flavors, highlighted with sharp acids and finishing with lingering notes of caramel and butter. Long and delicious.",Chateau Ste. Michelle,US,90,23,Sémillon
104736,Canoe Ridge 1999 Oak Ridge Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Washington),"The effusive, floral, fragrant nose opens into phenomenal tangerine and satsuma orange flavors, enlivened with spice and a wonderful, refreshing mouthfeel (from barrel fermentation). Best Buy.",Canoe Ridge,US,90,12,Gewürztraminer
104737,Château Souverain 1998 Winemaker's Reserve Chardonnay (California),"After you've had oceans of Chardonnay and don't think there's room for a drop more, along comes a wine like this to change your mind. It's not just the peach, pear and tropical fruit, or the honeyed, vanilla-scented buttered toast, or the oriental spices, or the clean acidity, or the rich, creamy texture. It's all of these together, in a balanced package.",Château Souverain,US,90,25,Chardonnay
104738,Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley),"This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine.",Columbia Winery,US,90,18,Sangiovese
104739,Kunde 1998 Reserve Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"A tremendously rich, oaky Chard that will blast your socks off and then some. The fruit is really complex, ranging from green apples to savory ripe peaches on into tropical fruit, and there's a dusty sprinkling of cinnamon and ginger. For sur-lie freaks, there's lots of creamy, yeasty, nutty notes contributing to this delicious, hard-hitting wine.",Kunde,US,90,30,Chardonnay
104740,Gainey 1998 Limited Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"This unusually rich wine has it all: ripe, round citrus and peach fruit compounded with oaky notes of vanilla, toast and butter. There's none of that grassy, straw character you find in so many North Coast offerings. With its fine, spicy finish, it's one of the best Sauvignon Blancs of the vintage. Contains 9% Sémillon.",Gainey,US,90,20,Sauvignon Blanc
104741,Andrew Will 1999 Ciel du Cheval Sangiovese (Yakima Valley),"This clear and bright cranberry-red wine sports a pungent nose with spice, cranberry, mocha and light cherry scents and flavors. Shows some interesting herbal nuances of thyme and oregano. Good focus in a fruit-forward style; tight and delicious with a pretty finish.",Andrew Will,US,90,23,Sangiovese
104742,Mirassou 1997 Harvest Reserve Merlot (California),"It's hard to ripen Bordeaux red varietals in Monterey, but this was a good vintage and Mirassou has some good vineyards. The fruit is scented with blackberries and plums and even deeper notes of chocolate, espresso, and smoked meat. There's also a generous dose of oak. It drinks fine and dry, and captures that magical quality of finesse and elegance despite its size, which is considerable. A plush, opulent wine.",Mirassou,US,90,18,Merlot
104743,Seven Hills 1997 Klipsun Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The big, powerful nose showcases blackberry, plum and brambly components. This tight, tannic, nicely constructed, ageworthy Cabernet features dark licorice streaks running through the long finish.",Seven Hills,US,90,25,Cabernet Sauvignon
104744,Woodward Canyon 1999 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Lovely, fruity wine, with ripe apples and peaches dominating. But there's also plenty of toasty new oak and roasted hazelnuts. Soft and approachable, with a bright, hot finish.",Woodward Canyon,US,90,28,Chardonnay
104745,Kiona 1999 Ice Wine Chenin Blanc (Yakima Valley),"Spice and melons illuminate the nose; the wine displays amazing concentration, with deep, syrupy peach and apricot fruit, and a bit of sugar and toasted coconut in the finish. Good acid balance. It's still very young, but immediately delicious.",Kiona,US,90,19,Chenin Blanc
104746,Bridlewood 1998 Winners Circle Syrah (Central Coast),"This represents the winery's attempt to recreate a Côte Rôtie-like wine. It's very similar to the regular bottling, with lots of ripe, fancy fruit, but it's oakier, with 50% new American barrels. What really distinguishes it, though, is its balance. The only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the tannins are so soft, and the acidity so low, that it's a bit flabby. Most people won't notice or care.",Bridlewood,US,90,25,Syrah
104747,Louis M. Martini 1997 Merlot (Chiles Valley),"An exceptional wine from this historic producer. Very aromatic, with generous blueberry, chocolate, mint, mushroom, and sweet charred oak. Rich and full-bodied. The fruity ripeness is delicious and sweet. The mouthfeel is luscious and creamy, and it finishes with a slight tannic bite. Probably at its youthful best now.",Louis M. Martini,US,90,25,Merlot
104748,Robert Mondavi 1998 Sauvignon Blanc (Stags Leap District),"This wine needs food so much, it practically cries out loud for it. It's like the essence of lemons and grapefruits, in a bone-dry, crisply tart package that makes the taste buds sing. The oak has been kept in the background to emphasize the clean, racy flavors, although partial sur-lie aging adds creamy notes. Oysters and this wine would be a marriage made in heaven.",Robert Mondavi,US,89,18,Sauvignon Blanc
104749,Merryvale 1998 Silhouette Chardonnay (California),"They took only the best fruit they could find for this expensive wine, and made only 1,280 cases of it. Using every Burgundian trick in the book, winemaker Steve Test has created a rich, creamy wine, long on smoky oak and yeasty lees, with impressive spice and fruit that veers toward peaches and more tropical notes.",Merryvale,US,89,55,Chardonnay
104750,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1998 Beckstoffer Ranch Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Bright, forward fruit and spice characterize this very rich, complex wine. The aromas veer toward banana and ripe peach and pear, with oriental spices, vanilla, and toast. In the mouth, the flavors are fruity, with a leesy streak. High acidity makes it a little sharp, while the texture is creamy. All in all, it's very balanced, except for that sharpness, which a year or two of aging should mellow.",Stag's Leap Wine Cellars,US,89,40,Chardonnay
104751,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1998 Reserve Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"The aromas are similar to the above wine, maybe a little less forward and earthier, but still dominated by tropical fruit and oaky complexities. It drinks quite a bit softer, though, with lower acidity, which makes it seem richer, fatter, and more user friendly. You can taste the pretty fruit on the finish.",Stag's Leap Wine Cellars,US,89,45,Chardonnay
104752,Columbia Winery 1998 Otis Vineyard Chardonnay (Yakima Valley),"The lovely, lushly fruity nose features plenty of buttery, roasted walnut scents from new oak fermentation. Despite the oak, it retains its freshness and acid balance, keeping it lively through a long, toasty finish.",Columbia Winery,US,89,50,Chardonnay
104753,Merryvale 1999 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (California),"On one level this is a straightforward wine, varietally correct with lemony flavors. It's very dry and tart, with some nutty, oily nuances from 12% Sémillon. However, it has that undefinable something that makes it elegant and interesting. You find yourself reaching for it when richer, oakier, lusher wines pall.",Merryvale,US,89,22,Sauvignon Blanc
104754,Seven Hills 1997 Seven Hills Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Blended with a small amount of Merlot (10%), this wine sends up a classic bouquet of cassis and berry, with a nice hint of mint. It’s well crafted, but tight and a little hard yet, especially in the finish. Built for aging.",Seven Hills,US,89,25,Cabernet Sauvignon
104755,Seven Hills 1997 Seven Hills Vineyard Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Blueberries, plums, and especially cherries, with a lovely, soft, beguiling bouquet of rose blossoms and chocolate. Crisply structured, with tight fruit, soft tannins, and a medium-weight, extended finish.",Seven Hills,US,89,25,Merlot
104756,Schug 1997 Heritage Reserve Merlot (Carneros),"The aromas are much more closed and dense than the regular bottling. Airing reveals plum, currant and cinnamon, and a good dose of toasty oak. Thick and dense, with fine fruit, intricate tannins, and oak. Delicious now, but will gain complexity with short-term aging. Only 329 cases produced.",Schug,US,89,35,Merlot
104757,Bridlewood 1998 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Dark, rich, and ultraripe yet balanced, this wine has plenty of charm. You can taste the warm California sunshine in each ripe sip. All kinds of wild berry and dark stone-fruit flavors mingle with spices and herbs, with a smoky, oaky overlay. Not great wine, but completely satisfying, and one that most will find lip-smackingly delicious.",Bridlewood,US,89,18,Syrah
104758,Eagle & Rose Estate 1998 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"A new wine from a new winery. It's actually from a warm easterly section of Napa, Pope Valley, that seems to coax honeydew and watermelon flavors from the grapes. The wine, which is very dry, has been given the royal treatment, with barrel fermentation and extended lees aging, so there's that lovely creamy mouthfeel; malolactic fermentation softens it even more. Pretty lush stuff from a winery to watch.",Eagle & Rose Estate,US,88,16,Sauvignon Blanc
104759,Hoodsport 1998 Reserve Chardonnay (Yakima Valley),"Smells oakier and fruitier than the regular bottling, with pretty peach and green-apple notes. There's a fair amount of richness on the palate. The fruit is spicy and ripe, and the oak adds spice and a sappy sweetness. Very balanced and likable, and certainly a nice food wine.",Hoodsport,US,88,17,Chardonnay
104760,Columbia Winery 1998 Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Columbia's second-tier Syrah uses Red Willow fruit from young plantings. The wine has a lovely black-plum color, and it's softly scented with chocolate, pepper and berries. Youthful, vibrant and sharp-toned, with the tart fruit cloaked in smooth, chocolaty tannins.",Columbia Winery,US,88,15,Syrah
104761,Bodegas Valdemar 2007 Conde de Valdemar Reserva (Rioja),"This is a textbook traditional Rioja, with dry spice, earth, light herbal notes and leather on the nose alongside cherry and plum scents. The palate is crisp, elegant and pure, with raspberry, vanilla, plum and leathery flavors. Modest complexity and elegance rise up on the finish. Drink through 2018.",Bodegas Valdemar,Spain,90,20,Tempranillo Blend
104762,Cameron Hughes 2011 Lot 418 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Blackberry, black currant, cassis, blueberry, dark chocolate and oak flavors mark this dry, tannic Cabernet. It shows real Oakville character, at a good price. Gets better and better as it breathes in the glass. Drink now–2015.",Cameron Hughes,US,90,25,Cabernet Sauvignon
104763,Il Poggione 2009 Brunello di Montalcino,"This forward Brunello opens with a fruit and spice fragrance of ripe black berries, cinnamon and hot red pepper. The dense palate delivers fleshy black cherry, ripe black raspberry, black pepper and cake spices alongside dusty tannins.",Il Poggione,Italy,90,85,Sangiovese
104764,Juris 2011 Tricata Red (Weinland Österreich),"Inky, floral depth with the spice of French oak leads to a fullish but toned body full of dark elderberry and plum fruits. There's a dark, brooding subtext despite the obviously mellowing oak flavors and a core of spice that will fulfil its promise with some further time in bottle. The concentrated power here comes from partially dried grapes. The tannins are pliable and supple. Enjoy as of 2016.",Juris,Austria,90,89,Austrian Red Blend
104765,Kale 2009 Alder Springs Vineyard Spirit Rock Syrah (Mendocino County),"Voluptuous and savory, this Syrah is blended with 10% Viognier and the aromatics benefit as a result, a minerally mix of floral raspberry and vanilla. Earthy and leathery on the palate, it shows a taste of baked plum on the finish, as well as tobacco, a nice balance between Syrah's darker and brighter sides.",Kale,US,90,40,Syrah
104766,Zull 2012 Innere Bergen Riesling (Niederösterreich),"Freshly cut green pears and crunchy, ripe apples have immediate appeal. This fruity freshness continues on the sleek and super-clean palate, which leads to a refreshing, long finish.",Zull,Austria,90,21,Riesling
104767,Château La Garricq 2011 Moulis-en-Médoc,"From an eight-acre vineyard, this is produced by the same team as Château Paloumey. Powerful and concentrated, it is also elegant, balancing its structure with good berry fruits and acidity. The tannins are still considerable, so drink from 2017.",Château La Garricq,France,90,50,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
104768,Château l'Évangile 2011 Blason de l'Evangile (Pomerol),"This is a delightfully perfumed wine, the second wine of Château L'Evangile. Smooth with ripe Merlot flavors, it's full and dense, conveying the sense that it will mature quickly. Drink from 2016.",Château l'Évangile,France,90,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
104769,Château Saint-Estèphe 2011 Saint-Estèphe,"A firm, dense wine, it currently shows plenty of dry tannins along with potentially ripe fruits. Already showing balance, it is developing into a complex, rich wine that will be full of black fruits and smoother tannins. Drink from 2017.",Château Saint-Estèphe,France,90,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
104770,Coeur d'Alene 2012 Viognier (Washington),"Generous, sweetly perfumed aromas of melon and lemon oil lead into a wine with precision and penetration. Spicy, candied ginger complements the citrus and tropical fruit, and barrel fermentation gives it a gently buttery mouthfeel.",Coeur d'Alene,US,90,24,Viognier
104771,Conti Costanti 2009 Brunello di Montalcino,"This wine shows real depth, beginning with earthy aromas of underbrush, ripe berried fruit, blue flower and smidge of leather. The palate offers a core of black cherry accented with notes of baking spices and a hint of truffle alongside a solid tannic backbone and nervous acidity that restrains the berry richness. Drink 2016–2024.",Conti Costanti,Italy,90,,Sangiovese
104772,Corte dei Venti 2009 Brunello di Montalcino,"This earthy Brunello leads with aromas of underbrush, mushroom, bay leaf, cherry and Mediterranean herbs. The palate offers juicy black cherry and ripe raspberry punctuated with cinnamon-spice, vanilla, mocha and licorice alongside smoothed but fleeting tannins. It's nicely crafted and boasts decent freshness for the vintage.",Corte dei Venti,Italy,90,26,Sangiovese
104773,DaMa 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Sagemoor and Conner Lee grapes go into this soft, plush, totally drinkable Chardonnay. Pretty fruit flavors of banana, apple and pear mingle seamlessly, and the wine has both balance and texture to spare. Drink it now for its poise and freshness.",DaMa,US,90,23,Chardonnay
104774,DiamAndes 2011 de Uco Malbec (Uco Valley),"Chunky, slightly rubbery aromas revolve around black fruits and oak. This is a dense, thick wine with blackberry, plum, fig and bitter chocolate flavors. The finish is dark and weighty in this meaty Malbec.",DiamAndes,Argentina,90,20,Malbec
104775,Emilio Moro 2010 Ribera del Duero,"Aromas of dried cheese, iodine and candied fruits settle with airing. In the mouth, this is firm and tannic, with savory, oaky flavors of hickory, blackened toast and roasted berry fruits. On the finish, there's both weight and elegance. Best from 2015 through 2020.",Emilio Moro,Spain,90,25,Tinto Fino
104776,Fattoria dei Barbi 2008 Riserva (Brunello di Montalcino),"This delivers a classic Sangiovese nose of wild cherry, leather, violet, iris, flint and spice. The dense palate reveals fleshy black cherry uplifted by menthol, eucalyptus, black pepper and sage. It's still young but should develop more complexity over the next few years. Drink 2016–2023.",Fattoria dei Barbi,Italy,90,90,Sangiovese
104777,Finca Lalande 2012 Made with organically grown grapes Malbec (Tupungato),"This wonderful under-$20 Malbec opens with a blast of black-fruit aromas as well as mild rubber scents and minerality. The palate is solid, with baked berry and integrated saline and mineral flavors. A bright, lively finish with a ton of berry essence closes this out.",Finca Lalande,Argentina,90,17,Malbec
104778,Fritsch 2012 Mordthal Grüner Veltliner (Wagram-Donauland),"Subdued aromas of pear peel give way to fleshy pear fruit framed with grapefruit acidity. Harmonious and reined-in, the wine combines elegance with fruity concentration.",Fritsch,Austria,90,,Grüner Veltliner
104779,Godspeed 2012 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Mount Veeder),"Chardonnays from Mount Veeder are rare, but the mountain can be a good home for that variety. Godspeed's 2012 is dry, brisk in acidity and enormously rich in tropical fruit, pear and apricot fruit flavors, enhanced with oak. Drink this Chard now with fancy fare, such as wild mushroom risotto, ahi tuna tartare and chicken lasagna.",Godspeed,US,90,30,Chardonnay
104780,Gross 2012 Sulz Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark),"Lovely restraint and a soft, pliable creamy core on this concentrated wine that boasts buffered acidity as clear and pretty as a bell.",Gross,Austria,90,,Sauvignon Blanc
104781,Rodney Strong 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This food-friendly Pinot Noir has a light body, dryness and crisp acidity that make it easy to pair with steaks, chops, salmon, mushroom risotto and similar fare. There's nothing shy, however, about the flavors, which brim with ripe raspberries, cherries and pomegranates, accented with toasty, spicy oak. Drink now–2017.",Rodney Strong,US,90,25,Pinot Noir
104782,San Lorenzo 2009 Bramante (Brunello di Montalcino),"Dark berry and baking spice aromas emerge from the glass and carry over to the juicy palate together with fleshy wild cherry, plum, black pepper, cinnamon and vanilla alongside big round tannins. Well balanced with great length, this poised wine already is accessible, so drink 2015–2019.",San Lorenzo,Italy,90,50,Sangiovese
104783,Schloss Gobelsburg 2012 Lamm Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Yeasty aromas give way to a ripe, plump palate. Varietally typical phenolic richness is kept in check by acidity.",Schloss Gobelsburg,Austria,90,41,Grüner Veltliner
104784,Schloss Gobelsburg 2012 Renner Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Juicy pear mingles into a savory, almost soy-spiced midpalate. Round and rich, it leads to a pleasantly bitter and ultra-clean finish.",Schloss Gobelsburg,Austria,90,26,Grüner Veltliner
104785,TeHo 2011 Red Blend Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Licorice, cardamom, blueberry and cassis aromas are subtle but complementary. A firm, healthy feel isn't particularly hard or tannic, while candied berry and sweet oak flavors lead to a long, smooth finish. This blend of 67% Malbec and 33% Cab Sauvignon is ripe, ready and exemplifies Mendoza's penchant for big wines with balance. Only 150 cases made.",TeHo,Argentina,90,95,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
104786,Tenuta di Sesta 2009 Brunello di Montalcino,"Although the color is an evolved garnet with brick edges, this wine offers a fresh nose of blue flower, gingerbread and ripe cherry with hints of toast and clove. The palate is evolved but still delivers ripe red cherry, vanilla and espresso along with smoothed tannins and soft acidity. Not much complexity and even though it's forward, it's also balanced. Drink through 2019.",Tenuta di Sesta,Italy,90,90,Sangiovese
104787,Terre Nere 2009 Brunello di Montalcino,"Brawny and forward, it leads with alluring fragrances of blue flower, underbrush, forest berries, balsamic herbs and leather. The juicy palate delivers mature wild cherry layered with white pepper, cinnamon, thyme and mint. While already deliciously accessible, it should develop some complexity in the next few years but don't hold too long. Drink through 2019.",Terre Nere,Italy,90,38,Sangiovese
104788,Gigante 2010 Ribolla Gialla (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"Vintner Adriano Gigante delivers a thick, resiny Ribolla Gialla with aromas of candied fruit, caramel and apricot. Try this pretty wine with ravioli stuffed with yellow squash.",Gigante,Italy,86,18,Ribolla Gialla
104789,Greek Wine Cellars 2010 Moscofilero Moschofilero (Mantinia),"White flowers and peach start this slightly simple but good white from Greece.

104790,Bella Ragazza 2010 Pinot Grigio (California),"On the sugary side, with sweetened pineapple, green apple and peach flavors that are brightened with crisp acidity. If you like your white wines on the sweet side, this is a good price.",Bella Ragazza,US,85,9,Pinot Grigio
104791,Vinum 2010 White Elephant White (California),"Shows plenty of oak influence, wrapping around tropical fruit notes. It's richly textured if somewhat low in acid, giving it a weighty feel on the palate. Drink now.",Vinum,US,85,17,White Blend
104792,Castelfeder 2010 15er Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),"There's a chalky, almost sweet element to the mouthfeel that recalls Pez candy or lemon soda. The fruit aromas are bright, intense and make up for the streamlined mouthfeel.",Castelfeder,Italy,85,15,Pinot Grigio
104793,Castelluccio 2009 Lunaria Sauvignon Blanc (Forlì),"Lunaria is a very interesting wine that represents one of the only attempts at making Sauvignon Blanc in the Forlì area of central Italy. Great for appetizers or easy vegetarian pasta dishes, it offers citrus, passion fruit and chopped sage aromas.",Castelluccio,Italy,85,16,Sauvignon Blanc
104794,Conte Ferdinando Guicciardini 2009 Massi di Mandorlaia Vermentino (Maremma),This crisp Vermentino would make a great companion to smoked salmon or swordfish carpaccio. The wine is bright and zesty with simple citrus and spice on the close.,Conte Ferdinando Guicciardini,Italy,85,19,Vermentino
104795,Estate Constantin Gofas 2008 Agiorgitiko (Nemea),"This wine has the plucky character typical of Greece, but with a polished spin. The nose is allspice, cherry and cocoa, and on the palate, dried fruits, coffee, mesquite smoke and chocolate. The wine finishes spicy and clean. Good, if not a bit aggressive. Pair with meat or hearty fare.",Estate Constantin Gofas,Greece,85,18,Agiorgitiko
104796,Fongoli 2009 Grechetto (Colli Martani),"Here's an easy Grechetto from central Italy that offers sun-denched aromas of apricot, honeysuckle, white mineral and a touch of tangy, sweet spice. This native Italian grape pairs beautifully with white meat, fish or salad.",Fongoli,Italy,85,18,Grechetto
104797,Kaiken 2010 Rosé of Malbec Rosé (Mendoza),"Generic on the nose, with undistinguished aromas of red fruits and candy. Feels plump and tastes a bit stalky, with generic red cherry, plum skin and candied flavors. Harmless and a touch sweet; drink well chilled.",Kaiken,Argentina,85,13,Rosé
104798,Lafazanis 2010 Electus Moschofilero (Mantinia),"This Moschofilero starts with honeyed peach, spice and lemon aromas, followed by a light touch of peach and minerals on the palate.

104800,Peter Franus 2010 Chardonnay (Carneros),"Shows the weakness of certain Napa Valley Chardonnays, with a dry herbaceous taste that accentuates the acidity and even the tannins. Although there are pineapple and oak flavors, the wine lacks interest.",Peter Franus,US,85,32,Chardonnay
104801,TerrAmore 2010 Pinot Grigio (Veneto),"Fresh, informal and fun (in a screwcap bottle), this organically farmed Pinot Grigio delivers bright aromas of cut grass, exotic fruit and citrus. It's an easy wine with a carefree attitude.",TerrAmore,Italy,85,12,Pinot Grigio
104802,Bogle 2010 Riesling (California),"You almost have to classify this Riesling as a dessert wine, because it crosses the line from off-dry into frankly sweet. It's an easy sipper, with honeyed tangerine and pear flavors. Could be a little brighter in acidity, though.",Bogle,US,85,10,Riesling
104803,Boutari 2010 Moschofilero (Mantinia),"Luscious aromas of ripe peach and citrus are followed by balanced waves of peach, lemon curd and melon on the palate.

104804,Carmel Road 2010 Pinot Noir (Monterey),"Shows ripe, grapey raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with a bite of citrusy acidity. A good Pinot Noir for drinking with roast salmon or a juicy hamburger.",Carmel Road,US,85,20,Pinot Noir
104805,Carpineto 2010 Vernaccia di San Gimignano,"Carpineto consistently delivers clean, territory-driven wines at competitive prices.

104806,Concannon 2009 Conservancy Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"A value-driven Cabernet to be sure and one, under the Conservancy mantra, that serves to raise funds to protect vineyard land from urban development. This vintage is full, with baked plum and earthy flavors, even-handed overall, with a hint of green bean on the finish.",Concannon,US,85,18,Cabernet Sauvignon
104807,DiamAndes 2010 Malbec (Uco Valley),"A heavy, dark and loud Malbec with bullish floral and black fruit aromas. Offers vise-grip tannins and borderline-overpowering blackberry flavors. Darkens on the finish, leaving espresso bitterness and chocolaty spice.",DiamAndes,Argentina,85,20,Malbec
104808,J. Lohr 2010 Falcon's Perch Pinot Noir (Monterey County),"It's a proper Pinot Noir in the silky texture and cherry and cola flavors, which finish smooth and dry. Other than that, it's rustic and heavy.",J. Lohr,US,85,17,Pinot Noir
104809,Laurenz V. 2010 Laurenz and Sophie Singing Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"Rounded, ripe, this Grüner is finely balanced, with apple flavors and a citric edge. It has intense acidity with a creamy character, and is ready to drink now. Screwcap.",Laurenz V.,Austria,85,15,Grüner Veltliner
104810,LaVelle 2010 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),This quickly veers from being delicately light into simply sour and grassy. Cucumber- and tart melon-flavored fruit fades into a short finish.,LaVelle,US,85,18,Pinot Gris
104811,Merryvale 2009 Hyde Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),"The vineyard is a great one, but this Chardonnay tastes way too oaky. It's swamped by buttered toast, vanilla and butterscotch flavors that barely give the underlying pineapple and lemon fruits a chance to express themselves.",Merryvale,US,85,48,Chardonnay
104812,Montresor 2010 Pinot Grigio (Valdadige),"Simple, clean and fresh, this no-fuss Pinot Grigio would pair nicely against Chinese take-out or an outdoor salad lunch. It shows clean aromas of citrus and white peach.",Montresor,Italy,85,14,Pinot Grigio
104813,Mullineux 2011 Kloof Street Chenin Blanc (Swartland),"There's a toasty streak that adds depth to the apple and melon fruit core of this wine. Soft tropical fruit accents appear in the mouth, with a brioche-flavored finish sealing the deal.",Mullineux,South Africa,85,20,Chenin Blanc
104814,Nals Margreid 2009 Müller-Thurgau (Alto Adige),This expression of Müller-Thurgau is thin and crisp in the mouth with lemon and candied fruit aromas on the nose. The aromas are flatter and less floral than you might expect from this fragrant grape variety.,Nals Margreid,Italy,85,20,Müller-Thurgau
104815,Chaltén 2007 Reserva Pinot Noir (Neuquén),"Opens with aromas of tomato leaf, fresh salsa and rubber. Later on red fruit enters the picture, and on the palate there's adequate raspberry and plum with a hint of chocolate. Feelwise, it's a touch gummy. But overall this wine from Patagonia is solid and proves that Argentinean Pinot Noir has its merits.",Chaltén,Argentina,85,15,Pinot Noir
104816,Drappier NV Carte d'Or Brut (Champagne),"The main nonvintage Champagne from Drappier is open, fresh and very easy. The fruit shows pears and apricots, tightened up by some green apple skins. The general feel is softness. An enjoyable apéritif Champagne.",Drappier,France,85,,Champagne Blend
104817,Fernwood 2005 Estate Zinfandel (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This is a drily astringent Zinfandel with bracing acidity, and it's a little tough right now. But it has enough briary mountain berry fruit, clove and savory pepper flavors to work against barbecued meats and poultry.",Fernwood,US,85,28,Zinfandel
104818,Hendry 2005 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Here's an oaky, ripe Chardonnay. It has pleasant pineapple, peach and lemon flavors and crisp acidity, and while it's not especially complex, it's a nice Chard for drinking now.",Hendry,US,85,25,Chardonnay
104819,Vino Sapien 2006 Thompson Vineyard Granddaddy Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"A little sweet and jammy, this Grenache has pie-filling flavors of cherries and raspberries, enriched with brown sugar, cinnamon, anise and cocoa. The richness is balanced with crisp acidity, but the wine is fundamentally simple and charming.",Vino Sapien,US,85,25,Grenache
104820,La Fenêtre 2006 Santa Barbara Highlands Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County),"The winery continues to try to figure out how to grow Cabernet in this remote part of the county. Ripeness isn't the problem. Structure is. The flavors are upfront in blackberries, cherries and currants, but complexity and dryness remain challenges.",La Fenêtre,US,85,26,Cabernet Sauvignon
104821,Mercer 2007 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is quite crisp and clean, with fairly typical flavors for Washington Pinot Gris. Which is to say, not nearly as fleshy as the wines from Oregon, with less of the juicy pear character. There's plenty of acid, more like green apple than ripe pear. It's a soundly made wine, clean and fresh, but less varietally distinctive than one would hope for.",Mercer,US,85,15,Pinot Gris
104822,Mercer 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a good, every day effort, much like the baseline Ste. Michelle Sauvignon Blancs. Lightly grassy, lemony and tart, it is an all-purpose quaffer.",Mercer,US,85,15,Sauvignon Blanc
104823,Merryvale 2004 Silhouette Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"A beat or two off the pace of previous vintages, the '04 is a little soft and one-dimensional. Tastes like it was baked by the heat, with jammy white and yellow fruit flavors that have a trace of bitterness.",Merryvale,US,85,48,Chardonnay
104824,Pietra Santa 2007 Amore Pinot Grigio (Cienega Valley),"A fine unoaked Pinot Grigio that shows the crispness, delicate body and richness you want in this variety. The citrus, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors could be drier, but lots of people will enjoy that edge of sugar.",Pietra Santa,US,85,24,Pinot Grigio
104825,Prospero 2006 Petite Sirah (Sonoma County),"Has Petite Sirah's inky black color and strong, thick tannins, and is very dry, with blackberry flavors that could be a little more intense. Unless you like your red wines right out of the cradle, this one really needs cellaring through at least 2010.",Prospero,US,85,35,Petite Sirah
104826,Robert Mondavi 2006 To Kalon Vineyard Reserve Fumé Blanc (Oakville),"Shows the beautiful acidity and dry crispness that this bottling invariably displays. But this cool, unbalanced vintage has taken its toll, with a green unripeness to the citrus fruit that even the winemaker admits was significantly cooler than average.",Robert Mondavi,US,85,40,Fumé Blanc
104827,Ortman Family 2005 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Black pepper dominates the aroma of this wine, along with black currants, grilled meat and something sweetly spicy and exotic, like a teriyaki dressing. In the mouth, it turns softly sweet and candied. Drink now.",Ortman Family,US,85,22,Syrah
104828,Mansard NV Premier Cru Brut (Champagne),"Soft, light, frothy apéritif style, pleasantly balanced with pear flavors. The aftertaste is soft, but the balance remains. Attractive, uncomplicated.",Mansard,France,85,,Champagne Blend
104829,Mosby 2006 Dolcetto (Santa Barbara County),"Dry and delicately structured, this is a high-acid, fairly austere wine. The flavors of tobacco, tart cherry skins and pepper will seem insufficient to fans of fruit-driven wines, but give this Dolcetto the right Italian-inspired fare, and it will shine.",Mosby,US,85,22,Dolcetto
104830,Covey Run 2006 Quail Series Fumé Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Just a splash of Chenin Blanc has been added to the blend, adding some lift to the aromas and suggestions of citrus blossom. The natural herbaceousness of Sauvignon Blanc has been kept in check, but the wine is clean and varietal. The flavors seem just a bit muted, almost thin, but it's a perfectly refreshing, if simple effort.",Covey Run,US,85,9,Fumé Blanc
104831,Foxen 2005 Range 30 West Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"A little tough and gritty, but with rich, forward flavors of berry and cherry jam, cocoa, clove and anise flavors. A Merlot-based Bordeaux blend.",Foxen,US,85,30,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
104832,Ursa 2005 Petite Sirah (Sierra Foothills),"Very soft, with low acidity and a texture as creamy as pudding, this Petite Sirah is made for early drinking. It's frankly delicious, with blackberry, currant, cherry, raspberry, chocolate and pepper-spice flavors that flood the mouth with opulence.",Ursa,US,85,24,Petite Sirah
104833,Wolff 2006 Petite Sirah (Edna Valley),"Edna Valley is a pretty chilly growing area, and you can taste the climate in the thick tannins and zingy acids that mark this Petite Sirah. It shows the variety's classic flavors of blackberries and currants, with notes of dried leather, tobacco, beefsteak and pepper.",Wolff,US,85,22,Petite Sirah
104834,Zaca Mesa 2006 Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley),"A bit too brittle and tart to earn a higher score. Could be bottle shock, but it's hard to tell. Tasted in May, the wine showed mint-infused cherry flavors and turned sharp on the finish. Made from 100% Grenache.",Zaca Mesa,US,85,32,Grenache
104835,Handley 2005 Handley Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"My bottle was sulfury on opening, but it blew off quickly. Then the wine revealed itself as very soft and somewhat simple, although dry. It shows modest flavors of ripe crushed summer blackberries and pepper.",Handley,US,85,25,Syrah
104836,Brander 2007 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),"A little green and minty, with sweet cherry, vanilla cream and smoke flavors brightened with crisp acidity. Drink now.",Brander,US,85,20,Merlot
104837,Messias NV 20 Anos Tawny (Port),"This is a sweet, soft Port, with plenty of fruit. Sultana and orange jelly flavors are cut with some spirit. The wine leans much more towards fruit than wood, unusual for a 20-year old. The wine, like all aged tawnies, is ready to drink.",Messias,Portugal,87,50,Port
104838,Pear Valley 2014 Pear Valley Vineyard Viognier (Paso Robles),"Orange, nectarine, canned pear and honeysuckle show on the nose of this quaffable bottling.

104839,Piccini 2011 Riserva (Chianti Classico),"Subdued aromas of blackberry, grilled herb and a hint of menthol lead the way.

104840,Quinta do Crasto 2014 Crasto White (Douro),"This is fresh, fruity and with an attractive creamy texture.

That makes for a balanced, light wine that is ready to drink.",Quinta do Crasto,Portugal,87,18,Portuguese White
104841,Quinta dos Avidagos 2014 Avidagos Red (Douro),"Towards the western end of the Douro vineyards, Avidagos is a fine place for table wines.

The wine will be ready from the end of 2016.",Quinta dos Avidagos,Portugal,87,15,Portuguese Red
104842,Quintay 2015 Q Grand Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Pungent aromas of wet stones, citrus fruits, grass and bell pepper are lively and intense.

104843,Rickshaw 2014 Pinot Noir (California),"A smooth texture and ripe, inviting black cherry flavors make this medium-bodied wine easy to drink and enjoy. Light spicy accents give it extra interest and moderate tannins help build the suave mouthfeel.",Rickshaw,US,87,15,Pinot Noir
104844,Robert Mondavi 2014 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This is a serviceable, soft and widely distributed wine, yeasty with aromas of baked bread circling concentrated red fruit and black tea. Light bodied and youthful, it holds on to oak and tannin on the finish.",Robert Mondavi,US,87,26,Pinot Noir
104845,Santa Ema 2015 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Some may find this coastal SB to be too green and vegetal, but that's cool-climate Leyda in a nutshell. Aromas of bell pepper and asparagus bring on the pyrazines, while in the mouth, this is spritzy and chunky. A reprise of green, pyrazine-driven flavors finish fresh but slightly bitter.",Santa Ema,Chile,87,14,Sauvignon Blanc
104846,Amity 2013 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),"This pure varietal wine conjures up apple and pear juice, finished dry and crisply defined. There is no particular nuance to it, but it's well made and quite quaffable.",Amity,US,87,22,Pinot Blanc
104847,Carpineto 2014 Chianti Classico,"Lively and straightforward, this opens with aromas of red berry, moist earth and a hint of chopped herb. The tart, easygoing palate offers juicy Marasca cherry and a dash of white pepper alongside zesty acidity.",Carpineto,Italy,87,19,Red Blend

104849,Casa Santos Lima 2014 Bonavita Red (Lisboa),"A mixed bag of varieties went into this soft and fruity wine. It has gentle tannins that are lifted by acidity and black currant fruitiness.

104850,Castell 2014 Castell Trocken Silvaner (Franken),"Smoke and dusty minerals meld into tart, green gooseberry and lime flavors on the palate of this brisk, dry Silvaner.

104900,Lovingston 2012 Josie's Knoll Merlot (Monticello),"This is a well-done effort from winemaker Riaan Rossouw, which shows how engaging, inviting and refined Merlot can be. Spiced red plum and red currant aromas seductively waft over dried fern and Mediterranean herb tones. Silky, soft tannins provide just enough structure to uphold the curvacious body of ripe red plum, sweet baking spice and additional dried herbs. Amazingly, this plush wine maintains excellent acidic verve, which carries along the entire medley of flavors to a persistent fruit-laden finish. Drink now for utter enjoyment.",Lovingston,US,91,20,Merlot
104901,Lynch Wines 2012 Strummer Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"Sweet oak perfume comes from 25% new French barrels.

104904,Monte da Ravasqueira 2013 Reserva Branco White (Alentejano),"This is, as always, a delicious wine. With intense green and yellow fruits that are both fresh and perfumed, it is ripe and rich.

104906,Fitapreta Vinhos 2013 Palpite Reserva Branco White (Alentejano),"Wood aged for a year, this wine is now rich and smooth.

104907,Fontanabianca 2012 Bordini (Barbaresco),"Perfumed berry, rose petal and baking spice aromas waft out of the glass.

104910,Anselmo Mendes 2014 Muros Antigos Alvarinho (Vinho Verde),"From the Vinho Verde subregion of Monção and Melgaço, this intense, bone-dry wine captures the richness of Alvarinho while not losing sight of its fresh lemon and crisp apple side.

This blend of 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet is dense, layered and shows just enough acidity to stay upright.

Drink through 2020.",Bodega Tacuil,Argentina,91,100,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon
104914,Boeger 2013 Estate Zinfandel (El Dorado),"A deep, dark color, ripe blackberry aromas and berry and spice flavors add up to a full-bodied, impressive wine from one of the oldest wineries in the Sierra Foothills. Smoky, oaky accents help shape the opulent fruit flavors, and enough firm tannins and lively acidity provide good balance.",Boeger,US,91,19,Zinfandel
104915,Ca' Nova 2007 Ghemme,"This opens with aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, resin, underbrush, leather, menthol and intense mint.

104919,Quady North 2010 Vinum Pro Virtus Arsenal Cabernet Franc-Merlot (Applegate Valley),"This is a reserve-level blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, given extra bottle-age prior to release. If you favor more than a hint of stem and herb in your Bordeaux-style blends, you'll find this quite interesting. Complex layers of iron, smoke, coffee grounds and cassis are in play, with a slight bitterness to the tannins. Pair it up with lamb chops right off the grill.",Quady North,US,91,40,Cabernet Franc-Merlot
104920,Rudius 2013 Stoney Vine Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"This winery's Walla Walla Valley debut displays aromas of ash, green olive, grilled asparagus, dried flowers, smoked meat and blue fruit.

104924,Treos 2014 Albariño (Willamette Valley),"Albariño is rare enough in Oregon, but virtually unknown in the Willamette Valley. This estate-grown wine, from a vineyard in the valley's southwest corner, makes a solid case for more. Tart and tangy with brightly defined flavors of grapefruit, apple and pineapple, this is deliciously bracing. There's nothing simple about it; the flavors extend and expand through a wonderfully long finish.",Treos,US,91,25,Albariño
104925,Pala 2014 Stellato (Vermentino di Sardegna),"Heady aromas of yellow field flower, dried Mediterranean herb and a whiff of tropical fruit lead the nose.

104928,Graceland 2008 Strawberry Fields Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Western Cape),"The alcohol is a bit too noticeable here, but overall this is a straightforward wine with nice mocha and spicy oak accents to the wild berry and red plum fruit frame.

104930,Ken Forrester 2010 Petit Pinotage (Western Cape),"Ken Forrester's Petit Pinotage is an accessible and easy-drinking wine from the notoriously love-it-or-hate-it grape that shows bright brambly forest berry and plum flesh flavors coupled with a touch of coffee-infused milk chocolate on the finish.

104932,Matsu 2008 Toro,"A big, burly wine that's loaded with power and fruit but is also tannic and drying. Tastes sort of raisiny and hot, with grating tannic scrub and fire in the hole. Pretty good but it doesn't have the purity, elegance and clean richness of the region's best wines.",Matsu,Spain,86,49,Tinta de Toro
104933,Michel Torino 2009 Don David Finca La Maravilla #6 Malbec (Cafayate),"A bit grassy and green, with good power, herbal black fruit aromas, spice and cola. The palate is very high in acidity, which at first creates a sheering sharpness and tart plum flavors. With more airing it grows rounder and more complex, but overall it's exacting, odd and funky.",Michel Torino,Argentina,86,20,Malbec
104934,Milbrandt 2008 The Estates Malbec (Wahluke Slope),"The grape's fruit flavors of blackberry and black cherry are nicely focused and rounded, but the vanilla and tobacco components, perhaps from aggressive oak treatment, bring in a bit of bitterness to the tannins. It's a fight to the finish—fruit or tannin—and too soon to pick a winner.",Milbrandt,US,86,25,Malbec
104935,Morro Bay 2008 Split Oak Estates Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"A fine, soft-tannined Cab made from Lodi Rules grapes missing some body in the midpalate, but otherwise fair for the $12 price.",Morro Bay,US,86,12,Cabernet Sauvignon
104936,Naggiar 2009 Estate grown Viognier (Sierra Foothills),"This late-harvest Viognier looks like a still wine as it comes out of the bottle, exploding with honey and wildflowers on the nose. Its fruitiness is restrained somewhat and would stand out paired with a crème brûlée—though on its own, the alcohol is overpowering.",Naggiar,US,86,28,Viognier
104937,Niner 2007 Bootjack Ranch Syrah (Paso Robles),"Defines a certain style of Paso Robles red wine, soft in structure, with easy, gentle tannins and ripe, pronounced fruit that's almost candied in sweetness. But in this case, the blackberry and cherry flavors are totally dry.",Niner,US,86,20,Syrah
104938,Ott & Murphy 2008 Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Light strawberry fruit is matched to barrel notes of cola and caramel. There is more than a trace of barnyard and earth, and the tannins have a tea-like astringency. The fruit seems a bit over-matched.",Ott & Murphy,US,86,16,Tempranillo
104939,Quinta das Maias 2010 Branco White (Dão),"A blend of six varieties, this is a perfumed wine, with flavors of wood aging to go with the yellow fruits. and a soft, rounded mouthfeel.",Quinta das Maias,Portugal,86,9,Portuguese White

104941,Red Truck 2009 Pink Truck Rosé (California),"Hard to say if this is a dessert wine or a rosé, because it's fairly sweet. Let's call it a rosé. And a pretty one it is, with savory orange, raspberry and vanilla flavors, balanced with acidity.",Red Truck,US,86,9,Rosé
104942,Rock Wall 2009 Monte Rosso Vineyard Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Hot and scoury in high alcohol, and that burn is accented by Zin's powerhouse tingly spices.

104943,Bulletin Place 2009 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia),"This value-priced label has turned out a notably successful 2009 Shiraz, combining red currants with enough meaty, savory elements to possess real interest.

104944,Tercos 2010 Malbec (Mendoza),"Woodsy, spicy aromas form a solid opening. There's adequate acidity on the palate along with raspberry, red plum and mild herbal notes. Racy, spicy and just toasty enough to rate well across the finish.",Tercos,Argentina,86,12,Malbec
104945,Tortoise Creek 2008 Cherokee Lane Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"Name checking an old stretch of Lodi highway, this Cab has more red cherry fruit than black as well as a noticeable trace of cedar, lacking in structure and acidity perhaps but decent enough—and very fairly priced—to pop open with a midweek steak. The grapes used are Lodi Rules certified green sustainable.",Tortoise Creek,US,86,11,Cabernet Sauvignon
104946,Trust 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A cooler vintage in the Columbia Valley, which perhaps contributes to a wine that seems rather hard and thin. Though the alcohol is listed at 14.2%, the fruit is tight and one dimensional, with dominant acidity. The wine is sound and balanced, but not showing its best at the moment.",Trust,US,86,28,Syrah
104947,Vecchia Cantina di Montepulciano 2008 Poggio Stella Merlot (Cortona),"This easy Poggio Stella Merlot is redolent of black cherry, mature raspberry and currants.

104957,Domaine Roblin 2010 Ammonites (Sancerre),"With three years' aging, this has developed into an almond- and toast-flavored wine that has softened and rounded the fruit. It has turned into a serious wine, its rich structure allied to the acidity. Ready to drink.",Domaine Roblin,France,90,37,Sauvignon Blanc
104958,Écluse 2010 Ensemble Lock Vineyard Red (Paso Robles),"This is one of the best Bordeaux blends now available from Paso Robles.

104980,Calatrasi 2005 Accademia del Sole Shiraz (Sicilia),"Thick and brawny, this Sicilian Shiraz boasts a deep purple hue and presents in-your-face aromas of prune, cedar, blueberry and white peppercorn. The consistency is chunky and chewy, like play dough, but drying mineral tones help cap those jammy fruit flavors.",Calatrasi,Italy,88,,Shiraz
104981,Cantele 2006 Amativo Red (Salento),"Thick and luscious with deep oak tones and big cherry fruit flavors, this southern Italian red is a real fruit bomb with plush cherry intensity and ripe berry flavors. The strong sunshine has done its part to shape a thick, succulent red wine.",Cantele,Italy,88,39,Red Blend
104982,Château de Fonbel 2006 Saint-Émilion,"Fresh black currant fruit gives this wine all the vivacity of the 2006 vintage. It is a beautiful, elegantly crafted wine, as you would expect from the same team as Château Ausone, and it has a lovely lightness of touch, with its final note one of delicious juiciness.",Château de Fonbel,France,88,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
104983,Château Fonréaud 2006 Listrac-Médoc,"A wood-dominated wine that shows spice and high toast characters. It has probably seen too much wood in its aging, but there is fruit there, its black currant ripeness hiding in the background. Hopefully, the wood will soften and integrate.",Château Fonréaud,France,88,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
104984,Château Maris 2005 Old Vine Syrah (Minervois La Liviniere),"A touch funky and green at first, that soon blows off to reveal a dark and wonderfully concentrated wine that shows some serious promise with age. Cassis, plum, black cherry, spice and tobacco fill the palate, with a long, smoky finish sealing the deal. Drink after 2010. Imported by The Portfolio Group.",Château Maris,France,88,36,Syrah
104985,Colli di Lapio 2005 Donna Chiara Campi Taurasini Aglianico (Irpinia),"This is a very attractive wine with bursting cherry notes and vibrant layers of sweet spice and clove. You'll also get root beer, chopped herbs, tobacco and leather: the wine is thick and firm with oak-driven flavors.",Colli di Lapio,Italy,88,30,Aglianico
104986,Domaine Lignères 2003 La Baronne Red (Corbières),"Moderately intense menthol, black licorice and African violets aromas on the nose. The mouth, full of ripe plum and dark cherries accented by notes of cocoa and fresh mint leaves, has a lovely balance and silky texture. Ends on a somewhat simple yet clean finish.",Domaine Lignères,France,88,11,Rhône-style Red Blend
104987,Drylands 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Archetypal Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, featuring pungent, herbal aromas to go alongside bold passion fruit notes. It shows ample weight in the mouth, even a slightly oily texture and pronounced green flavors that persist a good long time. Probably best with fresh tomato or strongly herbal dishes.",Drylands,New Zealand,88,15,Sauvignon Blanc
104988,Elki 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Elqui Valley),"Pleasant and melony on the nose, without the sharp, piercing aromas that sometimes push Chilean SB over the edge. New from the north of Chile, Elki is medium-bodied and generous, but not too angular. It's a whole wine with common citrus flavors as opposed to something demanding and sharp.Drink right away.",Elki,Chile,88,15,Sauvignon Blanc
104989,Prager 2004 Madeline Riesling (Napa Valley),"Honey-sweet and direct, with citrus jam, apricot essence, crème brûlée and vanilla cream flavors. Fine with white cookies, lemon chiffon pie, pineapple sorbet.",Prager,US,88,35,Riesling
104990,Rietvallei Estate Wine 2007 Juanita Rosé Cabernet Sauvignon (Robertson),"Fresh, fruity and charming, this rosé offers full-bodied flavors of strawberry and spice that are balanced and complex. A step above the typical flirty rosé, the wine gives style and substance and will handle heartier dishes—think Moroccan tagine or grilled, spiced fish.",Rietvallei Estate Wine,South Africa,88,19,Cabernet Sauvignon
104991,Salvatore Molettieri 2006 Cinque Querce Aglianico (Irpinia),"This is a pleasantly intense wine with resiny aromas of tar, tobacco and smoked cedar wood. It has a dense, impenetrable personality and there are slightly bitter tannins on the close.",Salvatore Molettieri,Italy,88,54,Aglianico
104992,Santa Maria 2004 Torre Pieve Chardonnay (Veneto),"Torre Pieve is a thick and creamy Chardonnay that is half aged in oak and half in stainless steel. These two methods give the wine structure and softness, but they also allow for the wine's natural fragrances to stay intact.",Santa Maria,Italy,88,30,Chardonnay
104993,Shaw and Smith 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills),"Shaw and Smith's Sauvignon Blanc has become emblematic of the Adelaide Hills style, combining tropical fruit with a grassy streak, all framed by zippy citrus flavors. This would work equally as an apéritif or with various seafood dishes.",Shaw and Smith,Australia,88,25,Sauvignon Blanc
104994,Talley 2006 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"The '06 had a hard act to follow after the classic 2005. It's not as great a Pinot Noir, showing a tannic brittleness and heaviness despite a rich undertow of red currants, mocha and spices. As good as it is, it lacks a refined elegance, and its hope lies in the cellar.",Talley,US,88,70,Pinot Noir
104995,Tedeschi 2005 Capitel San Rocco Red (Rosso del Veronese),"Tedeschi's Ripasso offers unique aromas that recall forest berry, bramble, green spice and crushed bay leaf. It's a succulent and slightly sweet tasting wine with bursting fruit flavors and thick, chewy density.",Tedeschi,Italy,88,23,Red Blend
104996,Mud House 2007 Swan Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Sweaty and pungent, loaded with overtones of crushed tomato leaf, this is an assertively herbal wine that requires careful food pairing, or a healthy preference for that style. It's not terribly weighty, but shows nice leafy complexity and a hint of curranty fruit. Try it with mussels steamed with lots of fresh herbs.",Mud House,New Zealand,88,19,Sauvignon Blanc
104997,Fattoria Alois 2006 Cunto Pallagrello (Campania),Here's a well-toasted red wine from Southern Italy that sees eight months of oak for added aromas of spice and tobacco. It has a sophisticated edge and loads of fresh fruit nuances at the core.,Fattoria Alois,Italy,88,45,Pallagrello
104998,Florio NV Fine Sweet (Marsala),"Candied fruit and caramel ride on the back of maple syrup, allspice and ground ginger. Marsala is for much more than cooking and you can try this wine with aged cheese or as an after-dinner drink.",Florio,Italy,88,12,Catarratto
104999,Vice Versa 2005 Le Petit Vice Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Sonoma-Napa),"This Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah blend is soft and ready to drink now. It's also very delicious, almost like a dessert pastry, with ultra-ripe black cherry, cassis, anise liqueur, melted milk chocolate and vanilla flavors that finish spicy-sweet.",Vice Versa,US,88,50,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
105000,Viña Mar de Casablanca 2008 Reserva Especial Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Pungent, zesty and quite varietal in its expression. The nose is racy and intense, with nettle, sweat and passion fruit aromas. Expect a wet, almost spritzy palate with green-edged fruit flavors and light herbaceousness. There's bite and sass to this one, and the finish is quite long.",Viña Mar de Casablanca,Chile,88,19,Sauvignon Blanc
