## Project Summary

Our project will distribute the number of covid-19 positive or death cases from the United States map. The size of the circles on the map will show the number of patients, and the exact number of patients will appear by clicking the circle shape on the map. Our primary database is public API from New York Times Covid-19 database. The goal of this project is to easily visualize the number of positive and death cases from each state on the US map and use the size of the circle to easily estimate and compare the number of cases between each state.
